<p>Inform is a project under active development, both by its original authors and by users who contribute extensions. Besides that, it belongs to an ecosystem of related tools and projects, and they develop, too.
<p>
<p>- New extensions are posted on the Inform website at:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">www.inform7.com
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>An RSS feed allows most modern Web browsers to keep track of developments since the last time this catalogue was visited.
<p>
<p>- New works published by authors using Inform are often announced at the IFDB (ifdb.tads.org), and/or by posts to
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">www.intfiction.org/forum
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>- New builds of Inform are identified by four-character codes: number, letter, number, number. They are posted on the Inform website (address above), usually once every month or two, and are accompanied by a detailed if rather technical change log. The remaining sections of this chapter give details of the changes in each build since 4S08, the first build considered solid enough for regular rather than experimental use: at the foot of each section the change log is reproduced verbatim in plain text, but the summary and links at the top are probably more useful.
<p>
<p>- Interpreters to play story files of the kind produced by Inform (and others) are also updated, but this is work going on independently of the Inform project as such.
