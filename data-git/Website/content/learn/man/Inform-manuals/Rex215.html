Obedient Characters</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Other characters can perform all the same activities that the player can; this does not always mean that they're willing to obey the player's instructions. By default, characters will refuse to obey commands of the form JULIA, WEST or ANTONY, TAKE THE PINCUSHION. Their objections can be overridden, however, and <b>The Hypnotist of Blois</b> implements a hypnotist who can make characters obedient at will.
<p>
<p>In <b>For Demonstration Purposes</b>, the character is only capable of a few actions at the outset, but can be taught new ones if the player performs them first.
<p>
<p>Often we want characters' obedience to be more selective. Just as the viewpoint character may be characterized in terms of what he will and will not do, so may others: <b>Generation X</b> demonstrates a character who will do what she's told, but who will comment unfavorably when the player asks for a nonsensical or repeated action, and who may eventually get fed up and leave.
<p>
<p>Characters can be given moral objections to certain commands, as well: <b>Virtue</b> defines a few kinds of actions as bad, so that the character commanded will refuse to perform them.
<p>
<p><b>Under Contract</b>, more subtly, has the character object if the player's commands implicitly require any behavior he considers inappropriate: for instance, if the player commands him to put his pants in a container, he will work out that this requires the removal of the pants as a preliminary. If we want to implement a similar character, we may want to simply copy his unsuccessful attempt rule and the table of his retorts, then replace his banter with lines of our choosing.
<p>
<p>The little example <b>Latin Lessons</b> allows us to make characters clever about vague commands: we can, for instance, write rules so that CLARK, EAT will have Clark sensibly pick something edible, rather than having the parser ask what we want Clark to eat.
<p>
<p>Finally, <b>Northstar</b> demonstrates how we might make Inform understand commands of the form ASK JOSH TO TAKE INVENTORY or ORDER JOAN TO WEAR THE ARMOR.

<p>If we're defining actions for other characters to follow, we may want to include them in our &quot;rule for supplying a missing noun&quot;. We can do this if we write our &quot;while...&quot; clause to apply to any actor, as follows:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Latin Lessons&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Latin Studio is a room. Rick is a man in the Studio.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dance-name is a kind of thing. Argentine tango, samba, merengue, cha-cha, street salsa are dance-names.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Dancing is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand &quot;dance [any dance-name]&quot; as dancing. Understand &quot;dance&quot; as dancing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for supplying a missing noun while an actor dancing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun is street salsa.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report someone dancing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The actor] dances a few steps of [the noun] for you.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report dancing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You dance a few steps of [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Persuasion rule for asking someone to try dancing: persuasion succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
