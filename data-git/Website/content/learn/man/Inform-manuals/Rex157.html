Reading Matter</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Many things can be read, from warning notices to encyclopaedias, and a range of techniques is needed to provide them because the quantity of text, and how it presents itself, can vary so much. With a small amount of very large type, the player should not need any command at all to read the text:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The road sign is in the Junction. The road sign is fixed in place. &quot;A road sign points north: 'Weston on the Green - 6'.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If the print is smaller, or the object portable, the player will expect to use the EXAMINE command:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The business card is in the Junction. The description is &quot;'Peter de S√®vres: consultant mnemonicist.'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But if the object is a leaflet, say, EXAMINE should only describe the cover: READ would be the command a player would expect to use to get at the text itself. Inform normally defines READ to be the same command as EXAMINE, which is good for things like the business card, but counter-productive here. <b>The Trouble with Printing</b> shows how to separate these two commands, allowing any thing to have a property called its &quot;printing&quot; for text produced by READ, which will be different from its &quot;description&quot;, the text produced by EXAMINE.
<p>
<p>If the object is a lengthy diary, say, nobody would read it from cover to cover in a single IF turn. We might then want to allow the player to turn the pages one by one, with commands like READ PAGE 4 IN DIARY or READ THE NEXT PAGE: see <b>Pages</b>.
<p>
<p>If the object is an encyclopaedic reference work, the player would consult named entries: see <b>Costa Rican Ornithology</b>, which allows commands like LOOK UP QUETZAL IN GUIDE.
<p>
<p>Still larger sources of text often occur in IF: libraries or bookshelves, where many books are found together, and it is clumsy to write them as many individual items. One approach is to simulate an entire bookshelf with a single thing: see <b>Bibliophilia</b>. (This is much like looking up topics in a single book, except that each topic is a book in itself.) Another is to provide each book as an individual item, but have them automatically join together into a single portable collection: see <b>AARP-Gnosis</b>.
<p>
<p>Signs, leaflets and encyclopaedias, being printed, have a wording which will never change during play. But sometimes the player reads something which acts of its own accord. Text substitutions are usually all that is needed to achieve this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The computer display is on the desk. The description is &quot;Giant green digits read: [the time of day].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is easy because we know all the variations we want. But what if we want the player to write his own text, for instance, adding to a diary? This is trickier, because it means storing text as the player typed it, and replaying it later. (And suppose the player types reams and reams of text, not just a few words as we might have hoped?) <b>The Fourth Body</b> and <b>The Fifth Body</b> show how to use an external file - a multimedia trick requiring features only available if the project is set to the Glulx story file format - to handle even the most difficult cases.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e157"><a href=Rdoc73.html#e157 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 432:  The Fourth Body</b></a><br>Notebooks in which the player can record assorted notes throughout play.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Some mystery games supply the player with an in-game system for taking notes, in case he doesn't want to rely on scraps of paper next to the computer. One way of doing this is to write out all the player's notes and observations into a notebook file, whose contents can be retrieved during play (or, indeed, after it).
<p>
<p>We'll first invent a general system for writing text into notebooks, by creating a new kind called jotter. Each individual jotter will have its own disc file, and there will be basically three things which can be done with jotters: erasing, reading and writing.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;The Fourth Body&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A jotter is a kind of thing. A jotter has an external file called the text file. A jotter can be fresh or used. A jotter is usually fresh. A jotter has a text called the heading.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The currently erased jotter is an object that varies.
<br>To erase (pad - a jotter):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the currently erased jotter is the pad;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;write &quot;[heading of the currently erased jotter][paragraph break]&quot; to the text file of the pad;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the pad is fresh.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To write in (pad - a jotter):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;append &quot;[the time of day]: [topic understood][line break]&quot; to the text file of the pad;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the pad is used.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To read (pad - a jotter):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You read: [paragraph break][text of the text file of the pad]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is all as might be expected, except perhaps for the business of the &quot;currently erased jotter&quot;. Why copy &quot;pad&quot; into this - why not simply write &quot;[heading of the pad]&quot;? The answer is that &quot;pad&quot; is a temporary &quot;let&quot; value, and cannot be used inside other phrases, such as the &quot;write ... to ...&quot; phrase.
<p>
<p>We want to erase any jotters when play begins, as otherwise text left over from any previous games will still be visible:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with pad running through jotters:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;erase the pad.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we need to create rules to allow the player to control reading, writing and erasing. Reading we will handle with the ordinary examining action, but we create new actions for writing and erasing. A nice little trick allows WRITE WHATEVER to default to writing WHATEVER in a notebook being carried.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining a used jotter (called the pad):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read the pad.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining a fresh jotter (called the pad):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;There is nothing of note in [the pad].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;write [text] in [something preferably held]&quot; as writing it in. Understand &quot;write [text]&quot; as writing it in. Writing it in is an action applying to a topic and one thing. Rule for supplying a missing second noun while writing: if a jotter (called the pad) is carried, now the second noun is the pad; otherwise say &quot;You will have to specify what to write that it.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check writing it in:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is not a jotter, say &quot;It would be better to write in a notebook.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out writing it in:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;write in the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report writing it in:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Under the current time, you write '[the topic understood]' into [the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;erase [something preferably held]&quot; as erasing. Erasing is an action applying to one carried thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check erasing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is not a jotter, say &quot;It's hard to see how.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out erasing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;erase the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report erasing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You scrub out all the entries in [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>That completes a general-purpose implementation of jotters, and we put it to use:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a jotter called your notebook. The file of Player's Observations is called &quot;notebook&quot;. The text file of your notebook is the file of Player's Observations. The heading of your notebook is &quot;Observations in the Pottingham Green Case&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Damp Hillside is a room. &quot;It is just after dawn: among the trees there is misty and pale blue light. [if Havers is in the location]The only saturated color in view is the orange-and-yellow jacket of [Detective Havers]. She is trying unsuccessfully to light a cigarette. [end if][paragraph break]The body itself is further down, closer to the bottom of the ravine. It would be foolish to speculate before seeing it, but the odds are that the corpse was rolled down after death. The ground is not steep enough for the fall itself to be deadly.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Detective Havers is a woman in the Damp Hillside. The description is &quot;She gives you a weak smile when you look at her: you know she hasn't slept more than three hours any of the last few nights.&quot; Havers is scenery.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Havers is carrying a jotter called Barbara's notebook. The file of Barbara's Observations is called &quot;barbara&quot;. The text file of Barbara's notebook is the file of Barbara's Observations. The heading of Barbara's notebook is &quot;I could murder a cup of tea&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The time of day is 6:32 AM.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining your notebook when your notebook is fresh:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Your notebook is blank. Back in the office, of course, there are a stack of others. But you brought a fresh notebook in a kind of weary hope. You're going to pretend, just for now, that this body might be unrelated to the graphic string of murders you're already investigating.&quot;
