<p>
<p>Almost all actions apply to things: the player picks them up, pushes them, looks at them and so on. We only occasionally need to recognise other kinds of value, but when we do, we can. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Adjusting it to is an action applying to one thing and one number.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;adjust [something] to [a number]&quot; as adjusting it to.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The substitution &quot;[a number]&quot; matches any number (actually any whole number that is not too large) typed by the player. Inform checks the various kinds being used to make sure that everything matches, so, for instance, this would be disallowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;adjust [something] to [something]&quot; as adjusting it to.
</font></blockquote><p>
