<p>Inform provides an either/or property called &quot;edible&quot; and action, &quot;eating&quot;, for consuming edible things:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The lardy cake is edible. After eating the lardy cake, say &quot;Sticky but delicious.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>One of Inform's rules is that a person can only eat what he or she is holding - normally realistic, but it does prevent, say, eating a cherry off the tree. A procedural rule can override this: see <b>Lollipop Guild</b>. <b>Delicious, Delicious Rocks</b>, on the other hand, adds a sanity check which prevents the player from automatically taking inedible things only to be told they can't be eaten.
<p>
<p>Inform does not normally simulate taste or digestion, but to provide foods with a range of flavours, see <b>Would you...?</b>; to make eating different foods affect the player differently, see <b>Stone</b>, or for the extreme case of poisoning foods, <b>Candy</b>. In <b>MRE</b>, hunger causes the player problems unless he regularly finds and eats food.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>For instance, if we want to give some objects a flavor:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Would you...?&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The House is a room. The mouse is an animal in the House.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries some green eggs and a ham.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A food is a kind of thing that is edible. Food has some text called flavor. The flavor of food is usually &quot;Tolerable.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Things are, in general, not edible by default, so we have to make them edible specifically in order to allow them to be eaten by the player. Here we've defined food to be edible by default, and we have given it a standard piece of flavor text.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The ham and the green eggs are food. The flavor of the green eggs is &quot;Delicious!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After eating something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun provides the property flavor, say &quot;[the flavor of the noun][paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;It's [noun]-flavored.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that we use &quot;if the noun provides a flavor...&quot; to make sure that the property exists before attempting to use it. Otherwise, there is the risk that we will try to print a property that does not exist, resulting in errors in the game.
<p>
<p>We will only get the &quot;It's [noun]-flavored.&quot; response if we successfully eat something that is not a food and does not have flavor text. To test this feature, let's suppose something that isn't exactly food but can theoretically be chewed on:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries some paper. The paper is edible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;eat ham / eat green eggs / eat paper&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
