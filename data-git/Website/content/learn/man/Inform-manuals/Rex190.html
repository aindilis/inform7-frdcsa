<p>The vehicle kind in Inform refers to an object which can carry at least one person, but is small enough to fit into a single location:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Garden is a vehicle called the motor mower.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can then apply different rules to a player going somewhere on foot or in the vehicle. <b>Peugeot</b> (a bicycle) is an easy example; <b>No Relation</b> (a car) adds an ignition switch to the vehicle; <b>Straw Boater</b> (a motorboat) gets around areas of lake where travel on foot is not just slower but impossible.
<p>
<p><b>Hover</b> (a sci-fi &quot;hover-bubble&quot;) changes the appearance of the landscape when it is seen from inside the vehicle.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we want the player to see a modified room description when he's viewing the place from inside a vehicle. There are several conceivable ways of doing this; the example here shows a rather advanced way, but is very flexible and will let us write all sorts of special cases.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Hover&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use full-length room descriptions.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Emerald City is a room. &quot;All the buildings are spires and none of them have doors.&quot; The Vast Desert is west of Emerald City. &quot;[if the player is in a vehicle]Outside, a[otherwise]A[end if] trackless waste stretches as far as the eye can see in every direction.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The hover-bubble is a vehicle in the Emerald City. &quot;Your hover-bubble awaits.&quot; The description is &quot;The hover-bubble is a clear globe-shaped vehicle capable of transporting you anywhere you could walk, but faster.&quot;  Understand &quot;bubble&quot; as the hover-bubble. The hover-bubble contains a chocolate wrapper and a parking ticket.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here's the tricky part, which relies on material from the chapters on Activities and Rulebooks:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The container interior rule is listed before the room description body text rule in the carry out looking rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the container interior rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the actor is the player and the player is in an enterable thing (called current cage), carry out the describing the interior activity with the current cage.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Describing the interior of something is an activity.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we've done that, we can write a &quot;rule for describing the interior&quot; of something, which will print whatever we like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for describing the interior of the hover-bubble:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The hover-bubble is transparent, but tints everything outside very faintly lavender.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In fact, as a special refinement, we could even say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for describing the interior of the hover-bubble when the hover-bubble contains more than one thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The hover-bubble is transparent, but tints everything outside very faintly lavender. Beside you you can see [a list of other things in the hover-bubble].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is other if it is not the player.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for listing nondescript items of the hover-bubble when the player is in the hover-bubble: do nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;get in bubble / look / west / take all / look / get out / east&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now anything that's beside us in the vehicle will be described during that first paragraph, rather than later on.
