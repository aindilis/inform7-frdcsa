<p>
<p>It is convenient to have a concise way to write down a constant list. Just as we could write &quot;231&quot;, say, or &quot;7:01 AM&quot; to refer to particular number and time constants, so we can write list constants:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let L be {1, 2, 3, 4};
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform recognises that &quot;{1, 2, 3, 4}&quot; is a set because of the braces, and looks at the entries inside, sees that they are numbers, and deduces that it is a constant whose kind of value is &quot;list of numbers&quot;. L is then a temporary list variable and we can add to it, remove things, and so on as we please - {1, 2, 3, 4} is merely its initial value.
<p>
<p>When constructing sets, it is worth noting that Inform requires spaces after commas in lists like this one (which seems a little harsh, but is necessary because otherwise many sensible literal specifications for units would be impossible - anyway, the reason isn't important here). So
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let L be {1,2,3,4};
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>would produce problem messages. But Inform does not require spaces round its braces.
<p>
<p>We call this way of writing a list &quot;brace notation&quot;. In mathematics, braces are usually used for sets, and properly speaking these are sequences not sets - so that &quot;{1, 2, 3, 4}&quot; is different from &quot;{4, 3, 2, 1}&quot; - but it is still a familiar notation. Similarly,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let L be {&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;pear&quot;, &quot;loganberry&quot;};
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>makes L a list of texts; and
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The marshmallow, the firework and the stink bomb are in the Scout Hut. The list of prohibited items is a list of objects that varies. The list of prohibited items is {the firework, the stink bomb}.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>makes a global variable (&quot;list of prohibited items&quot;) with kind of value &quot;list of objects&quot;, and whose initial value is to contain two things: the firework and the stink bomb. More exotically, if we need to make lists of lists:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let L be {{1, 2}, {6, 7, 8}};
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>gives L the kind of value &quot;list of lists of numbers&quot;, with (initially) two entries: the list {1, 2} (a list of numbers), then the list {6, 7, 8} (ditto).
<p>
<p>Constant lists are convenient, too, when a column in a table needs to contain lists:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The duck, the orange, the cider, the cinnamon and the orange are in the Kitchen.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Table of Requirements
<br><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">recipe</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">ingredients</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;duck Ã  l'orange&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">{the duck, the orange}</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;spiced cider&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">{the cider, the cinnamon, the orange}</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>A special word about the constant list &quot;{ }&quot;. This means the list with no entries - the empty list. If we try to create a new &quot;let&quot; variable M with
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let M be { };
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then Inform will produce a problem message, because it cannot tell what sort of list M will be: a list of numbers, or texts, or times, or...? On the other hand, writing
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let M be { };
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>is fine provided that M already exists, and then does the obvious thing - empties M. Similarly, a table column in which every entry is &quot;{ }&quot; produces a problem message unless the heading for that column spells out the kind of value stored within it: for instance, &quot;ingredients (list of texts)&quot;.
<p>
<p>All of this is a notation for constant lists only, not some sort of gluing-things-together operation. So this, for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let L be {100, the turn count};
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>is not allowed, even though &quot;the turn count&quot; is a number: because it is a number that varies, the braces do not contain constants, and therefore this is not a list constant.
