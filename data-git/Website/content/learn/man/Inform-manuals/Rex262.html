<p>It is too easily assumed that room descriptions are what the player sees, but as <b>The Undertomb</b> demonstrates, they might just as easily include ambient sounds.
<p>
<p>So Inform's &quot;listening to&quot; action is the audio equivalent of &quot;examining&quot;, rather than &quot;looking&quot;. Despite this the player can type LISTEN, which Inform understands as listening to the everything in the location at once. A simple but effective way to handle this is shown in <b>The Art of Noise</b>.
<p>
<p><b>Four Stars 2</b> adjusts the idea of &quot;visibility&quot; to make it behave differently for listening purposes: this introduces a formal idea of &quot;audibility&quot;.

<p>This example involves redesigning the LISTEN command, removing its built-in function and replacing that with something more ambitious. We will learn more about how to do this later on.
