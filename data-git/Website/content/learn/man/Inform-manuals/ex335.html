Arithmetic with units</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>The example equations in the previous section carried out quite a lot of arithmetic, but they may have given the impression that Inform always allows arithmetic - which is not true.
<p>
<p>This is actually a good thing, because it keeps us from error. For instance, Inform will not allow:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Equation - Newton's Totally Bogus Law
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F = m^2
<br>where F is a force, m is a mass.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because whatever you get when you square a mass, you don't get a force - in the same way that a length times another length makes an area, not another length. Physicists call this &quot;dimensional analysis&quot;, and it often provides clues about which equations are right. Just after the Second World War, someone correctly worked out the explosive power of an atomic bomb without any classified information simply by guessing what values would appear in the formula, and then finding the simplest equation they could appear in.
<p>
<p>In general, Inform will not allow numerical kinds of value to be multiplied or divided by each other (or square or cube rooted) unless we give it instructions that this would make sense.
<p>
<p>Of course, there's plenty we can still do without any need for such instructions. For instance, going back to weight,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Weighbridge is a room. &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is [100kg multiplied by 3].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...will produce the text &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is 300kg.&quot; Here Inform knows that it makes sense to multiply a weight by 3, and that the result will be a weight. Similarly, Inform allows us to add and subtract weights, and several different forms of division are allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The blackboard is in the Weighbridge. &quot;A blackboard propped against one wall reads: '122 / 10 is [122 divided by 10] remainder [remainder after dividing 122 by 10]; but 122kg / 10kg is [122kg divided by 10kg] remainder [remainder after dividing 122kg by 10kg]; and 122kg / 10 is [122kg divided by 10] remainder [remainder after dividing 122kg by 10].'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>When we visit the Weighbridge, we find:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A blackboard propped against one wall reads: &quot;122 / 10 is 12 remainder 2; but 122kg / 10kg is 12 remainder 2kg; and 122kg / 10 is 12kg remainder 2kg.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Whereas we are not allowed to divide 122 by 10kg: that would make no sense, since 122 is a number and not made up of kilograms. Inform will produce a problem message if we try. Similarly, Inform won't normally allow us to multiply two weights together - but see the next section.

<p>
<p>Here we build very slightly on the existing liquid implementation to add a puzzle where the player puts out a fire with a bucket of water. Most of the liquid implementation remains the same as before, but we are now in a position to understand the line at the end of section 1, where we understand the names of containers according to the liquids they contain.
<p>
<p>The new material, pertaining to extinguishing fires, is at the bottom in section 2.

<p>
<p>We will skip implementing the Pacific ocean itself, though the example Lakeside Living shows how to incorporate large bodies of water into our liquid simulation.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The liquids are seawater. [We could include others, but for the moment...]
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of drinking a fluid container when the liquid of the noun is seawater:

<blockquote><font color="#000080">The bucket is a fluid container carried by the player. The liquid of the bucket is seawater. The current volume of the bucket is 64.0 fl oz.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The fire is a fixed in place thing in the beach. &quot;A low fire crackles here, left over from an attempt at s'mores much earlier in the evening.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of touching or rubbing or taking the fire, say &quot;You're not such a glutton for punishment.&quot;

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;drink seawater / pour seawater on fire / x bucket / i&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is still a specific implementation: if we wanted to weave liquids together with a full-scale burning model (as in &quot;In Fire or in Flood&quot;), where pretty much any object in the game can be flaming (currently on fire) or damp (extinguished), we might generalize our rule to
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of pouring something into a flaming thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the second noun is damp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the current volume of the noun is 0.0 fl oz;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The second noun] goes out in a great hiss.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Of course, the merging of fire and liquids also raises the possibility of gasoline and explosives, of heating and boiling liquids, etc.: as always, it's wise to incorporate a simulation that is only as detailed as the game's interactions really justify.
