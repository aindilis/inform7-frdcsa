<p>
<p>We have already seen, in the chapter on Descriptions which is a forerunner of this one, that Inform provides not only &quot;adjacent&quot; as a way of seeing if one room is directly connected to another, but also &quot;the best route from A to B&quot;, which allows us to see if any sequence of moves connects them.
<p>
<p>Something similar - in fact, simpler - is allowed for any relation between objects. Suppose we would like to go sledging: we can go downhill, but not up. Some quite distant places may be reachable, while others close by may not be, even if lower than us, because they would involve climbing again at some point. The following would implement this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Overlooking relates various rooms to various rooms.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to overlook (it overlooks, they overlook, it overlooked, it is overlooked, it is overlooking) implies the overlooking relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Garden overlooks the Shrubbery. The Folly overlooks the Garden. The Shrubbery overlooks the Sundial Plot. The Old Ice House overlooks the Garden.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After looking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;This wintry vantage point overlooks [the list of rooms overlooked by the location].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the way be the next step via the overlooking relation from the location to the Sundial Plot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the way is a room, say &quot;To sledge downhill to the Sundial, aim for [the way].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;It is not possible to sledge downhill to the Sundial.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here we're making use of:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>next step via </b>(relation of values to values)<b> from </b>(object)<b> to </b>(object)<b></b> ... <i>object</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_nextstep -->

<p>This phrase tries to find a shortest route between the two given endpoints, using the given relation of objects to determine single steps. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">next step via the overlooking relation from the Folly to the Chinese Lake
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The result is the special object value &quot;nothing&quot; if the two endpoints are the same or if no route exists.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>number of steps via </b>(relation of values to values)<b> from </b>(object)<b> to </b>(object)<b></b> ... <i>number</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_numbersteps -->

<p>This phrase tries to find the length of a shortest route between the two given endpoints, using the given relation of objects to determine single steps. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">number of steps via the overlooking relation from the Folly to the Chinese Lake
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The result is 0 if the two endpoints are the same, or -1 if no route exists.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>Another example would be the &quot;six degrees of separation&quot; game, where it is claimed that any two people on Earth are connected by a sequence of up to six acquaintances. In an Inform implementation, we might talk about &quot;the next step via the friendship relation from George Bush to Saddam Hussein&quot;, for instance, a phrase likely to evaluate to Donald Rumsfeld, and then
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the number of steps via the friendship relation from George Bush to Saddam Hussein
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>would be... but that would be telling.
<p>
<p>As with route-finding through the map, finding &quot;the next step via&quot; a relation can be slow. For instance, suppose we have dozens of articles of clothing all partially revealing each other, connected by two relations - overlying and underlying. Then &quot;the next step via&quot; these relations allows us to establish what can be worn on top of what else. If we need to calculate this often, and there are enormous wardrobes of clothes to choose from, speed starts to matter.
<p>
<p>Once again there is a choice of algorithms: &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot;, where &quot;fast&quot; needs much more memory. To make route-finding for a given relation &quot;fast&quot;, we have to declare it that way:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Overlying relates various garments to various garments with fast route-finding.
<br>Overlapping relates various garments to each other with fast route-finding.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Otherwise, the &quot;slow&quot; method will be used.
<p>
<p>This &quot;with fast route-finding&quot; note can only be added to various-to-various relations. (Although route-finding through various-to-one and one-to-various relations is fully supported, it exploits the relative simplicity of these problems to use a more efficient algorithm than either &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;slow&quot;.)
<p>
<p>(- See Adjacent rooms and routes through the map for route-finding through the map rather than a relation.)

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e45"><a href=doc218.html#e45 STYLE="text-decoration: none">***<b><b>Example</b> 235:  The Problem of Edith</b></a><br>A conversation in which the main character tries to build logical connections between what the player is saying now and what went immediately before.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose that we have a core set of issues we want to be able to bring up with all the characters, and we want characters to draw intelligent connections between different conversation topics. We will need some model of how things relate to one another, so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;The Problem of Edith&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Suggestion relates things to each other. The verb to suggest (it suggests, they suggest, it is suggested) implies the suggestion relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A subject is a kind of thing. The current subject is a thing that varies. greeting is a subject.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;ask [someone] about [any subject]&quot; as asking it about the subject. Understand &quot;tell [someone] about [any subject]&quot; as asking it about the subject.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Asking it about the subject is an action applying to one thing and one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out asking it about the subject:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'Hmm, [the second noun],' says [the noun]. &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relate the current subject with the second noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the current subject is the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And if we wanted to offer the player some hints about angles he could pursue:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of thinking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You contemplate [a list of things suggested by the current subject].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For that matter, we could use the same system to have characters make sense of any physical evidence the character shows them:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of showing something which suggests the current subject to someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The second noun] nods impatiently.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of showing something to someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the next subject be the next step via the suggestion relation from the noun to the current subject;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the next subject is a subject:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try asking the second noun about the subject the next subject;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The second noun] shrugs.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the left hand status line is &quot;Discussing: [current subject]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the right hand status line is &quot; &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Broughton Hall is a room. Lady Uckfield is a woman in Broughton Hall. &quot;Lady Uckfield sits at her desk, looking wholly composed.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The nasty letter is a thing carried by the player. The nasty letter suggests infidelity and penmanship. The ten-pound note is carried by the player. It suggests money.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Infidelity is a subject. Infidelity suggests marriage and divorce. Marriage suggests love. Marriage, love, and divorce are subjects.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Penmanship is a subject. Penmanship suggests education. Education is a subject. Class status and money are subjects. Class status suggests education. Money suggests class status and marriage.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The current subject is divorce.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we can define what gets said when the subject is changed, regardless of whether the segue was introduced in speech or by a shown object. Since rows are blanked after use, the speaker will never repeat herself; if we provide more than one line about the same pair of topics, the first one will be used, then the second, and so on, until the table runs out:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To relate (initial - a subject) with (next - a subject):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat through Table of Remarks:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the initial is starting entry and the next is the final entry:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[comment entry][paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blank out the whole row;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say paragraph break.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Table of Remarks
<br><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">starting</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">final</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">comment</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

'But I can think of no happier investment.'&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

That was patent from the outset.'&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we had more than one character in the scenario, we could provide multiple tables, but this will do to demonstrate the idea.
<p>
<p>Of course, we can override specific instances, if we want the character always to say the same thing regardless of how we came to this point:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking Lady Uckfield about the subject penmanship:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the current subject is penmanship;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;She sighs. 'So few people write really beautifully these days.'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;think / ask lady about infidelity / show nasty letter to lady / show note to lady / think / ask lady about divorce / ask lady about love / ask lady about marriage / ask lady about divorce / ask lady about love / ask lady about penmanship&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We would have to be careful about this system, since we have applied a various-to-various relation to every single object in the game. In practice it would probably be wisest to restrict it a bit, with judicious definitions of kind and so on.
