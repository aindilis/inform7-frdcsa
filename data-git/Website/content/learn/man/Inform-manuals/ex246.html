<p>
<p>We have now seen how to change the properties of rooms and things, and also any freestanding values which may have a bearing on the model world. We are not allowed to change the kind of anything during play. Our remaining freedom is to move things around. It would make no sense to move rooms around, because rooms are the fixed reference points in our geography, but anything else is mobile. This even includes things which are supposedly &quot;fixed in place&quot;, for unlike the player, we have god-like powers. (There are minor restrictions: backdrops are trickier to move, since they are present in several rooms at once - see the next section. And doors, at the junction between two rooms, cannot be moved.)
<p>
<p>Here is how to move something:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>move </b>(object)<b> to </b>(object)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_move -->

<p>This phrase moves the first-named object to the second. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">move the genie's lamp to Aladdin's Cave;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The first object named has to be a thing; the destination must be a room, as here, a container, a supporter, or a person. When something is moved, all its parts and contents (and all their contents, and so on) move with it. If the thing being moved is a person, then the destination is required to be a room or an enterable container. (In particular, a person cannot be carried by another person.)
<p>
<p>Two options can be used if the object being moved is the player.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">move the player to Aladdin's Cave, without printing a room description
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>omits the description which would otherwise be produced. A compromise is to use:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">move the player to Aladdin's Cave, without printing an abbreviated room description
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which gives a full description if the player has never been here before, but only a brief one if it is a familiar scene. These options have no effect for any other objects being moved.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>If the destination is a person, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">move the genie's turban to Aladdin;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then it will be carried rather than worn. We could arrange for it to be worn instead by writing
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now the genie's turban is worn by Aladdin;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Now...&quot; is a much more flexible phrase than &quot;move&quot;: more on this shortly.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e246"><a href=doc128.html#e246 STYLE="text-decoration: none">**<b><b>Example</b> 119:  Meteoric I and II</b></a><br>A meteor in the night sky which is visible from many rooms, so needs to be a backdrop, but which does not appear until 11:31 PM.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>The timing of the meteor's arrival uses features of Inform which the next chapter will go into at greater detail: suffice to say that the game below begins at half past eleven, and that one turn later is meteor time.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Meteoric I&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The time of day is 11:30 PM.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 11:31 PM:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move meteor to the great outdoors;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;A meteor streaks across the sky.&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The great outdoors is a region. The Spanish Balcony is east of the Inner Court. The Court and Balcony are in the great outdoors. Inside from the Court is the Swimming Pool.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The meteor is a backdrop. Instead of doing something to the meteor, say &quot;The meteor is no longer visible, now nothing more than a memory.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;wait / wait / examine meteor / west / examine meteor / in / examine meteor&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Or for something a little slower-moving and with no after-image:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Meteoric II&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The time of day is 4:30 PM.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 4:31 PM:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move Phobos to the great outdoors;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Phobos rises from the western horizon.&quot;
<br>At 10:06 PM:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove Phobos from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Phobos sets over the eastern horizon.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The great outdoors is a region. The Martian Balcony is east of the Inner Court. The Court and Balcony are in the great outdoors. Inside from the Court is the Heavy Water Swimming Pool.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Phobos is a backdrop. Instead of doing something to Phobos, say &quot;Phobos orbits a mere 6000km above you, which is practically touching range for astronomy. On the other hand, astronomy isn't all that practical.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;wait / wait / examine phobos / west / examine phobos / in / examine phobos&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Though we should not really use Earthly time-keeping, since the Martian day is about half an hour longer than ours.
