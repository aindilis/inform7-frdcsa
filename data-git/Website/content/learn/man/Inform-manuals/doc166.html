<p>In the part it plays in stories, time is like space. The endings of a scene (along with its beginning) are like the map connections leading out of a room. The Scenes index keeps track of the &quot;map of time&quot; through which these possible story-lines traverse. Some works of IF will have immensely complicated story-lines in only a few rooms, some will have no scenes at all despite a sprawling geography. The Scenes and World index tabs, side by side, show both kinds of map.
<p>
<p>Just as Inform uses a simple but practical design for the boundaries between rooms (map connections and doors, that is), it also simplifies transitions between scenes. Scenes are based on states of things: we give circumstances for them to begin or end. There is no phrase with the power to say &quot;make Act II begin right now&quot;, so perhaps it is worth explaining why not. The state-based approach was chosen because:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">* it guarantees that each action falls entirely inside, or entirely outside, of any given scene (and therefore that &quot;during...&quot; clauses in the conditions for a rule are not affected by rule ordering);
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">* it ensures that scene changes occur outside actions, like every turn rules;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">* it promotes a style of writing which makes it clearer to the reader of the source text when a scene begins and ends, and what conditions are guaranteed to be true during it;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">* it makes it possible for the Scenes index page to show this information in a communicative way.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Settings in IF where one revisits the same location but at a different time, or after a dramatic change, have historically been difficult to test properly and prone to mistakes. (The classic example would be where a character killed during Act I reappears unharmed in Act II.) The design of scenes is an attempt to encourage a style of writing which minimises the risk of these accidents.
<p>
<p>Since scenes are, in the end, only a convenient way to organise rules, and do nothing that cannot be done by other means, this simplified system of scene changing does not really restrict us.
