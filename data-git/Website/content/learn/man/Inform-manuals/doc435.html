<p>
<p>Whole routines, object and class definitions (or any other directives) can be pasted in wholesale using sentences like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include (-
<br>[ MyInform6Routine a b; return a*b; ];
<br>-).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Such inclusions are pasted into the final compiled code at the end of the file, after the I6 grammar has been declared.
<p>
<p>In such extracts, we sometimes need to refer to objects, variables or values which can't be described using I6: or rather, which can be described, but we don't know how. To this end, any text in an inclusion written in &quot;(+&quot; and &quot;+)&quot; parentheses is treated as an I7 value, and compiled accordingly, with all type-checking waived for the occasion. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include (-
<br>Global my_global = (+ the tartan rucksack +);
<br>-).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here &quot;the tartan rucksack&quot; is translated into &quot;O18_tartan_rucksack&quot;, or something similar: the I6 object created to represent the rucksack. Thus the actual line of code produced is
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Global my_global = O18_tartan_rucksack;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The material between &quot;(+&quot; and &quot;+)&quot; is generally treated as a value, and thus compiles to the I6 form of that value. But it could also be a property name, which compiles to the I6 form in question, or a defined adjective, which compiles to the name of the routine to call which tests whether that adjective is true.
<p>
<p><b>Two warnings.</b> The material in &quot;(-&quot; and &quot;-)&quot; is called template code, and it is not quite treated as literal. That means certain characters cause Inform to react:
<p>
<p>1. Beware of accidental &quot;(+&quot; usage - for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include (-
<br>[ MyCleverLoop i; for (++i; i<10; i++) print i; ];
<br>-).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>looks reasonable, but contains &quot;(+&quot; and &quot;+)&quot;. Spaces around the first &quot;++&quot; would have been enough to avoid this one; &quot;+)&quot; is only significant where it follows a &quot;(+&quot;.
<p>
<p>2. Beware of placing an &quot;@&quot; character in the first column, that is, immediately following a new line. (In template code this marks off paragraph divisions.) So for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include (-
<br>[ Set_Stream ret;
<br>@glk 67 ret;
<br>];
<br>-).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>is tripped up by the Glulx assembly language opcode &quot;@glk&quot; because this occurs in column 1. Indenting it with a little space or a tab is enough to avoid the problem.
