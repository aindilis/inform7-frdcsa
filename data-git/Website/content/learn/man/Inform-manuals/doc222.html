<p>
<p>So far in this chapter, we've only seen relations which exist permanently during play. The relationships might change - sometimes Red Riding Hood would be in the Woodcutter's Cottage, sometimes not - but the relations themselves were eternal.
<p>
<p>In fact, though, we can also create relations to be dynamic data structures, like lists or indexed texts:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>let </b>(a name not so far used)<b> be </b>(description of relations of values to values)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_letrelation -->

<p>This phrase creates a new temporary variable, and sets its value to the identity of a newly created and equally temporary relation. These last only for the present block of phrases, which certainly means that they exist only in the current rule. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let the password dictionary be a relation of texts;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This makes a purely temporary various-to-various relation between texts, which lasts as long as the temporary value &quot;password dictionary&quot; lasts. By default, relations are various-to-various, but we could instead write, say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let the nicknames catalogue be a various-to-one relation of texts;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>Such a relation exists only in the current phrase, and is destroyed when the phrase finishes, like any other &quot;let&quot;. Of course there's no verb whose meaning is this relation, but that's no obstacle, because we can manipulate it using &quot;relates&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now the nicknames catalogue relates &quot;Trudy&quot; to &quot;Snake-eyes&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(At present such a relation cannot be used outside its own phrase.)
