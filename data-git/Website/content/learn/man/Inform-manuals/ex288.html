<p>
<p>Let us suppose that somebody gets off the train, after all, so that a second scene follows on.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Brief Encounter is a scene. Brief Encounter begins when Train Stop ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The effect of this is that they occur in sequence. If we add a third to the chain of scenes:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Village Exploration is a scene. Village Exploration begins when Brief Encounter ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...we find another chance to fool ourselves: if we check the Scenes index again, we can see the linkages between these scenes, but we also see that Brief Encounter never ends (despite its name). All we have said is that another scene begins where Brief Encounter leaves off, but it never does, so this is moot.

<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a jug of water. Understand &quot;pour [something] on [something]&quot; or &quot;splash [something] at/on [something]&quot; as throwing it at.

<p>
<p>So much, we had before. Now, suppose we want a conversation style which allows the player to move conversation forward by asking appropriate questions, but which will keep moving forward even if he doesn't. To this end, we provide a table -- a borrowing from a later chapter. In the table, we record two ways of performing each conversation bit, one which reflects the player's participation, and one in which the character moves things onward:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Table of Conversation
<br><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">topic</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">reply</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">quip</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;dream/dreams/nightmare/nightmares/sleep&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;'Sleep well?' you ask solicitously.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">'Not really,' she replies, edging away from you. So much for that angle.&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;'Ghastly nightmares,' she remarks. You nod politely.&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;marriage/love/wedding/boyfriend/beau/lover&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;'So,' you say. 'This is a little weird since we just met, but, um. Would you like to get married?'</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">She looks at you nervously. 'Do I have to?'&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;'I, er,' she says. 'I hope I'm not supposed to marry you or something.'&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;marriage/love/wedding/boyfriend/beau/lover&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;'I was told I was going to marry you and inherit the kingdom,' you say, apologetically. 'Would that be very bad?'</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">'Oh, it's not you -- I'm seeing someone,' she says, smiling quickly.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">You try to think how to point out that it's been a hundred years since she last saw her boyfriend.&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;'Do you think I could go look for someone? I'm seeing him, you see, and I think I've been... sick... for a while, so he might be worried.'</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You try to think how to point out that it's been a hundred years since she last saw her boyfriend.&quot;
<br><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;marriage/love/wedding/boyfriend/beau/lover&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;'You've been up here for a hundred years,' you say. An unpleasant thought occurs to you. 'Was your young man in the castle somewhere?'</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">She shakes her head mutely.&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;She goes to the window and looks out at the now-fading thicket of briar. 'That took a while to grow,' she observes. 'I've been up here longer than I thought.'</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You shrug, uncomfortable.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking an awake beauty about a topic listed in the Table of Conversation:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now Beauty is passive;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[reply entry][paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blank out the whole row.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;now Beauty is passive&quot; line prevents her from making any conversation of her own on a turn when we've spoken to her. This keeps the conversation from progressing too quickly.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of telling an awake beauty about something: try asking the noun about it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking an asleep person about something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] snores.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Marriage Proposal ends when the number of filled rows in the Table of Conversation is 0.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn during Marriage Proposal:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Beauty is active:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat through Table of Conversation:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[quip entry][paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blank out the whole row;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make no decision.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>After we've generated any spontaneous conversation, we return her to her regular active state.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn: now Beauty is active.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Marriage Proposal ends: end the story saying &quot;This is going to take some explaining.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x beauty / wake beauty / pour water on beauty / ask beauty about sleep / z / ask beauty about marriage&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we have a scenario in which the player can ask her some questions out of order if he really wants to, but the scene will not end until the basic conversation topics have been exhausted. If we wanted to add some other chit-chat, not as part of the main conversation strand, but by way of optional enrichment, we might make a second conversation table and record alternative outcomes in it.
