<p>
<p>A variety of &quot;conditions&quot; have already appeared in this documentation. A condition is a phrase which describes a situation which might be true, or might be false, and examples might include:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Kite is in Bishopsgate
<br>the score is greater than 10
<br>Sherlock Holmes suspects a woman
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These are all examples of sentences, formed by putting nouns either side of a verb, and clearly a wide range of conditions can be written this way. But there are also a few special conditions built into Inform which have a fixed wording, and test questions difficult to address with ordinary sentences. For instance:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><i>if</i> <b>in darkness</b><i>:</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_indarkness -->

<p>This condition is true if the player currently has no light to see by. Note that the test is more complicated than simply testing
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the player is in a dark room, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>since the player might have a torch, or be inside a cage which is itself in a dark room, and so on.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>Another example of a condition not easily written as a sentence is:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><i>if</i> <b>player consents</b><i>:</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_consents -->

<p>This condition is unusual in doing something and not simply making a silent check: it waits for the player to type YES (or Y) or NO (or N) at the keyboard, and then is true if the answer was yes. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;Are you quite sure you want to kiss the Queen? &quot;;
<br>if the player consents:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>Whether it's put to the player like this or not, testing a condition is really asking a question, and there is always a yes/no answer. In Inform this answer is not usually a value (unlike in some other computer programming languages), but it can be made into one.
<p>
<p>Firstly, we need a special kind of value to hold answers like this. It's called &quot;truth state&quot;, and it has just two possible values, written as &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;. We then need:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>whether or not </b>(a condition)<b></b> ... <i>truth state</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_whether -->

<p>This phrase converts a condition into its result as a value, which is always either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">whether or not 20 is an odd number
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>produces the truth state &quot;false&quot;. This is mostly useful for storing up results to look at later:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let victory be whether or not all the treasures are in the cabinet;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and then subsequently:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if victory is true, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>As another example, in most stories this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;showme whether or not in darkness.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...will produce a line:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;whether or not in darkness&quot; = truth state: false
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In short, &quot;truth state&quot; is a kind of value like any other. That means it can be the kind of a variable:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Salvation earned is a truth state that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and it can similarly be used in table columns, lists, or anywhere else where values are allowed.
