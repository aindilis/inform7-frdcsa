<p>
<p>Finding hidden objects is a classic puzzle in IF. <b>Beachfront</b> provides the most basic example, an object that becomes visible only when we have searched the papers on a cluttered desk. <b>Beneath the Surface</b> takes this further, giving all large furnishings the ability to conceal items, and allowing the player to put things underneath other things, as well as find them. <b>Flashlight</b> adds an extra twist to the puzzle by requiring that the player have a flashlight to shine under a bulky object in order to find what lies underneath.
<p>
<p>Looking inside an object is generally handled by the searching action, and we could extend that to allow the player to search multiple or complex objects. <b>Matreshka</b> turns the puzzle on its head by allowing the player to search a whole room systematically with only a single command.
