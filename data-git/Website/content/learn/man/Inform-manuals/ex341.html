<p>
<p>When several different lines of grammar are supplied to meet the same circumstances, it makes a big difference what order they are tried in. For instance, suppose we have:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;photograph [a door]&quot; as photographing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;photograph [an open door]&quot; as photographing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The second line is more specific than the first, so Inform takes these grammar lines the other way around: it checks for &quot;open door&quot; before it checks for &quot;door&quot;. That didn't matter here, since both lines came out with the same result (the action of photographing), but it matters very much in the next example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;employ [a door]&quot; as opening.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;employ [an open door]&quot; as entering.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>More subtle is a line already seen:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;on/in/inside&quot; or &quot;on top of&quot; as &quot;[within]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here Inform puts &quot;on top of&quot; before &quot;on/in/inside&quot;, since otherwise only the &quot;on&quot; of &quot;on top of&quot; will be recognised.
<p>
<p>Mistakes always take precedence over non-mistakes: this is intended to make sure that
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;take umbrage&quot; as a mistake (&quot;Nobody takes umbrage in this game, mister.&quot;).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will take precedence over
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;take [something]&quot; as taking.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>even if there is, in fact, a character called Mr Nimbus Umbrage so that the command could conceivably make sense.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>We now have the mechanisms in place to do some fairly sophisticated renaming of objects. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Some Assembly Required&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Garment type is a kind of value. The garment types are vest, t-shirt, polo shirt, mandarin blouse, button-down, shell, experiment.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assign identities.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: assign identities.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To assign identities:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through torsos:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reassess item.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To reassess (item - a torso):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of things which are part of the item is 0:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now garment type of the item is vest;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if exactly two short sleeves are part of the item:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a collar is part of the item,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now garment type of the item is polo shirt;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise now garment type of the item is t-shirt;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if exactly two long sleeves are part of the item:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a collar is part of the item,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now garment type of the item is button-down;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise now garment type of the item is mandarin blouse;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a collar is part of the item and the number of sleeves which are part of the item is 0, now garment type of the item is shell;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise now garment type of the item is experiment.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before cutting something which is worn by the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try taking off the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of cutting something when something is part of the noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You cut up [the noun], snipping off [a list of things which are part of the noun].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every thing which is part of the noun is in the holder of the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of cutting something which is part of something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You carefully snip [the noun] free.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player carries the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of a torso: say &quot;[garment type]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A torso is a kind of thing. A torso is always wearable. Understand &quot;shirt&quot; or &quot;blouse&quot; as a torso. A torso has a garment type. Understand the garment type property as describing a torso. A sleeve is a kind of thing. A short sleeve is a kind of sleeve. A long sleeve is a kind of sleeve. A collar is a kind of thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;sew [something] to [something]&quot; as affixing it to. Affixing it to is an action applying to two things. Carry out affixing something to something: now the noun is part of the second noun. Report affixing something to something: assign identities; say &quot;You sew [the noun] on, creating [a second noun].&quot; Understand the command &quot;stitch&quot; as &quot;sew&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of affixing something to something when the second noun is worn: say &quot;You're wearing [the second noun]!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of affixing a torso to something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is a torso, say &quot;Couture for Siamese twins is a daring field, but a bit of a niche market.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise try affixing the second noun to the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of affixing a sleeve to something when at least two sleeves are part of the second noun: say &quot;[The second noun] already sports [a list of sleeves that are part of the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of affixing a collar to something when a collar is part of the second noun: say &quot;[The second noun] already sports [a list of collars that are part of the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining something when something is part of the noun: say &quot;Stitched to [the noun] [is-are a list of things which are part of the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here is where the issue of precedence arises. We want to encourage Inform to select a cuttable object that is part of something else, rather than one of the spares:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is removable if it is part of something. Understand &quot;cut [removable thing]&quot; as cutting.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Boutique is a room. &quot;Still festively strewn with the confetti and streamers of the Grand Opening party, and still almost totally customer-free.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a torso. The player carries three short sleeves. The player carries two long sleeves. The player carries two collars.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;sew collar to shirt / i / sew short sleeve to shirt / g / i / x polo shirt / cut collar / i / cut shirt / sew long sleeve to shirt / i / sew long sleeve to shirt / i / sew collar to shirt / g / i / wear button-down&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
