<p>
<p>Very occasionally, for out-of-the-ordinary games, we want to make major changes to the way that Inform ordinarily understands commands.
<p>
<p><b>Cloves</b> shows how we might read adverbs in the player's command: adverbs are challenging because they can legitimately appear anywhere in a command structure, so must be found and accounted for before the rest of the command is understood.
<p>
<p><b>Fragment of a Greek Tragedy</b> goes further, substituting a keyword-recognition parser for the usual structure of commands and objects.
<p>
<p>Less drastically, menus of numbered options can temporarily replace or augment standard commands. <b>Down in Oodville</b> demonstrates how to add a list of transporter destinations from which the player may choose by numeral.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Now and then in IF there is a situation where we need to ask the player for a numbered choice rather than an ordinary action command. What's more, that numbered choice might change during the game, so we don't want to just hard-wire the meanings of &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;3&quot; whenever the player types them.
<p>
<p>A better trick is to keep a list or table (we'll use a table here because it involves slightly less overhead) recording what the player's numerical choices currently mean. Then every time the player selects a number, the table is consulted, and if the number corresponds to something, the player's choice is acted on.
<p>
<p>In our example, we'll have a transporter pad that can take the player to any room in the game that he's already visited. (Just for the sake of example, we'll start him off with a few pre-visited rooms.)

<p>
<p>If we wanted to replace the regular command structure entirely with numbered menus, or use menus to hold conversation options, we could: several Inform extensions provide these functions.
