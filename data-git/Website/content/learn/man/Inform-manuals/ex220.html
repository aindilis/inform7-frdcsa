Arithmetic with units</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>The example equations in the previous section carried out quite a lot of arithmetic, but they may have given the impression that Inform always allows arithmetic - which is not true.
<p>
<p>This is actually a good thing, because it keeps us from error. For instance, Inform will not allow:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Equation - Newton's Totally Bogus Law
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F = m^2
<br>where F is a force, m is a mass.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because whatever you get when you square a mass, you don't get a force - in the same way that a length times another length makes an area, not another length. Physicists call this &quot;dimensional analysis&quot;, and it often provides clues about which equations are right. Just after the Second World War, someone correctly worked out the explosive power of an atomic bomb without any classified information simply by guessing what values would appear in the formula, and then finding the simplest equation they could appear in.
<p>
<p>In general, Inform will not allow numerical kinds of value to be multiplied or divided by each other (or square or cube rooted) unless we give it instructions that this would make sense.
<p>
<p>Of course, there's plenty we can still do without any need for such instructions. For instance, going back to weight,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Weighbridge is a room. &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is [100kg multiplied by 3].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...will produce the text &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is 300kg.&quot; Here Inform knows that it makes sense to multiply a weight by 3, and that the result will be a weight. Similarly, Inform allows us to add and subtract weights, and several different forms of division are allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The blackboard is in the Weighbridge. &quot;A blackboard propped against one wall reads: '122 / 10 is [122 divided by 10] remainder [remainder after dividing 122 by 10]; but 122kg / 10kg is [122kg divided by 10kg] remainder [remainder after dividing 122kg by 10kg]; and 122kg / 10 is [122kg divided by 10] remainder [remainder after dividing 122kg by 10].'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>When we visit the Weighbridge, we find:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A blackboard propped against one wall reads: &quot;122 / 10 is 12 remainder 2; but 122kg / 10kg is 12 remainder 2kg; and 122kg / 10 is 12kg remainder 2kg.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Whereas we are not allowed to divide 122 by 10kg: that would make no sense, since 122 is a number and not made up of kilograms. Inform will produce a problem message if we try. Similarly, Inform won't normally allow us to multiply two weights together - but see the next section.

<p>
<p>Liquids, and all substances that can be mixed or broken off in partial amounts, pose a challenge to model in interactive fiction. The following example is a simple one, but adequate for many scenarios.
<p>
<p>We start by assuming that all liquids in the game will always appear in containers. The player can pour liquids from one container to another, and the containers keep track of how full they are and describe themselves appropriately. The player can also refer to containers by content.
<p>
<p>Mixture, however, is not allowed, nor is it possible to put liquids on other objects, pour them out on the ground, etc. These ideas would require a more complicated set-up.

<p>
<p>We have allowed all liquids to be drunk, but it would be possible also to add checking, if we had a game where some liquids were beverages and others were, say, motor oil.

<p>
<p>This is probably a drier description than we would actually want in our story, but it does allow us to see that the mechanics of the system are working, so we'll stick with this for the example.
<p>
<p>Now we need a trick from a later chapter, which allows something to be described in terms of a property it has. This way, the story will understand not only &quot;pitcher&quot; and &quot;glass&quot; but also &quot;pitcher of lemonade&quot; and &quot;glass of milk&quot; -- and, indeed, &quot;glass of lemonade&quot;, if we empty the glass and refill it with another substance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the liquid property as describing a fluid container. Understand &quot;of&quot; as a fluid container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now the scenario itself:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Porch is a room. The porch swing is an enterable supporter in the Porch. &quot;An inviting swing hangs here at the end of the porch, allowing you to enjoy the summer with a cool beverage, and watch your neighbor Ted mowing his lawn with the very last manual powerless lawnmower on the block.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The glass is a fluid container carried by the player. The liquid of the glass is milk. The current volume of the glass is 0.8 fl oz.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The pitcher is a fluid container in the Porch. The fluid capacity of the pitcher is 32.0 fl oz. The current volume of the pitcher is 20.0 fl oz. The liquid of the pitcher is lemonade.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Ted's Lawn is outside from the Porch. Ted is a man in Ted's Lawn. &quot;Ted has taken off his shirt, but still seems a bit oppressed by the sun.&quot; The description of Ted is &quot;He looks hot. In all senses.&quot;

<p>

<p>
