<p>
<p>Finding hidden objects is a classic puzzle in IF. <b>Beachfront</b> provides the most basic example, an object that becomes visible only when we have searched the papers on a cluttered desk. <b>Beneath the Surface</b> takes this further, giving all large furnishings the ability to conceal items, and allowing the player to put things underneath other things, as well as find them. <b>Flashlight</b> adds an extra twist to the puzzle by requiring that the player have a flashlight to shine under a bulky object in order to find what lies underneath.
<p>
<p>Looking inside an object is generally handled by the searching action, and we could extend that to allow the player to search multiple or complex objects. <b>Matreshka</b> turns the puzzle on its head by allowing the player to search a whole room systematically with only a single command.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check ransacking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is not the location, say &quot;You can hardly search [the noun] from here.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out ransacking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the player can see a closed openable unlocked container (called target):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[target]: [run paragraph on]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try opening the target.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Russian Gift Shop is a room. In the Russian Gift Shop is a large wooden doll. It is closed and openable. In the large wooden doll is a medium wooden doll. It is closed and openable. In the medium wooden doll is a small wooden doll. It is closed and openable. In the small wooden doll is a tiny solid wooden doll.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now we need to borrow from a later chapter for the command that will make this work:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;search [any visited room]&quot; as ransacking.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;search gift shop&quot;.
