Liquids</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Liquids are notoriously difficult to simulate well. A fully thorough approach consumes endless storage and can be very finicky to write and keep realistic. It is essential to decide what aspect of a liquid's behaviour is actually needed in a given story, and to simulate only that. For instance, if we only need a little chemistry, where a player can add (say) water to salt and make a solution, we do not want to fool around with calculating quantities or concentrations: what's important is that &quot;some water&quot; (amount unspecified) combines with &quot;some salt&quot; to produce &quot;some salty water&quot;. We should no more calculate precisely here than we would work out where all the furniture is to the nearest inch. Good advice for handling liquids is to simulate the least amount of realism possible, but no less.
<p>
<p>Sometimes all we want is a down-in-one drink: we needn't simulate the actual liquid, just the bottle it comes in, and all we need is to handle the &quot;drinking&quot; action. See <b>Beverage Service</b>, and also <b>3 AM</b>, where carbonated drinks can be shaken - again simulating the vessel, not the liquid.
<p>
<p>Some elementary biochemistry in <b>Xylan</b> is done simply by... well, the point is that two different liquids are represented by single things each, and a chemical reaction simply switches one for the other.
<p>
<p>In <b>Frizz</b>, we allow any container to be filled (only) with water (only) and we simulate what happens to any solid objects also inside: some waterproof, some not. <b>Flotation</b> provides a well (always full of water), with rules to determine whether things dropped into it should sink or float.
<p>
<p>Next we move up to quantitative approaches, where we remember not just whether a liquid is present, but how much of it. In its simplest form, we could have a drinking vessel from which we draw in sips, so that it can be full, half-empty or empty: see <b>Thirst</b>.
<p>
<p>The example with the best compromise between simulation quality and complexity is <b>Lemonade</b>. Here we provide a kind of container called a &quot;fluid container&quot;, not just a single cup, and each such vessel has a given &quot;fluid capacity&quot;. Each holds only a single liquid at a time (so no mixtures) and can be empty or full to any level (rounded off to the nearest 0.1 fl oz). We can fill one vessel from another (unless it would make a mixture). But liquids leaving these vessels must be consumed - drunk or poured away without trace: we cannot make pools on the floor, or carry liquids in our cupped hands. There is no object representing &quot;lemonade&quot;: there are only fluid containers, but which can be called LEMONADE if that is what they now contain.
<p>
<p><b>Savannah</b> is a light elaboration of Lemonade, showing how liquids might be poured on other objects, as for instance to extinguish a fire.
<p>
<p><b>Noisy Cricket</b> extends <b>Lemonade</b> to allow for mixing, though then the number of different possible mixtures is so large that complexity increases greatly. <b>Lakeside Living</b> extends <b>Lemonade</b> differently to add a &quot;liquid source&quot; kind, a form of fluid container which has infinite fluid capacity and is scenery - ideal for a lake, river or spring.

<p>
<p>Liquids, and all substances that can be mixed or broken off in partial amounts, pose a challenge to model in interactive fiction. The following example is a simple one, but adequate for many scenarios.
<p>
<p>We start by assuming that all liquids in the game will always appear in containers. The player can pour liquids from one container to another, and the containers keep track of how full they are and describe themselves appropriately. The player can also refer to containers by content.
<p>
<p>Mixture, however, is not allowed, nor is it possible to put liquids on other objects, pour them out on the ground, etc. These ideas would require a more complicated set-up.

<p>
<p>We have allowed all liquids to be drunk, but it would be possible also to add checking, if we had a game where some liquids were beverages and others were, say, motor oil.

<p>
<p>This is probably a drier description than we would actually want in our story, but it does allow us to see that the mechanics of the system are working, so we'll stick with this for the example.
<p>
<p>Now we need a trick from a later chapter, which allows something to be described in terms of a property it has. This way, the story will understand not only &quot;pitcher&quot; and &quot;glass&quot; but also &quot;pitcher of lemonade&quot; and &quot;glass of milk&quot; -- and, indeed, &quot;glass of lemonade&quot;, if we empty the glass and refill it with another substance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the liquid property as describing a fluid container. Understand &quot;of&quot; as a fluid container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now the scenario itself:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Porch is a room. The porch swing is an enterable supporter in the Porch. &quot;An inviting swing hangs here at the end of the porch, allowing you to enjoy the summer with a cool beverage, and watch your neighbor Ted mowing his lawn with the very last manual powerless lawnmower on the block.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The glass is a fluid container carried by the player. The liquid of the glass is milk. The current volume of the glass is 0.8 fl oz.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The pitcher is a fluid container in the Porch. The fluid capacity of the pitcher is 32.0 fl oz. The current volume of the pitcher is 20.0 fl oz. The liquid of the pitcher is lemonade.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Ted's Lawn is outside from the Porch. Ted is a man in Ted's Lawn. &quot;Ted has taken off his shirt, but still seems a bit oppressed by the sun.&quot; The description of Ted is &quot;He looks hot. In all senses.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player: place Ted in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing something to Ted when the player is in the Porch: say &quot;You can't really interact with Ted from this distance, except in the sense of eyeing him surreptitiously.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of giving an empty fluid container to Ted: say &quot;Yes, taunt the poor man, why don't you?&quot;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:
