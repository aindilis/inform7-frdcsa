<p>The &quot;device&quot; kind provides for the simplest form of machine: one which is, at any given moment, switched on or switched off. Inform looks after this state, but leaves it to us to make the machine actually do something:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The air-conditioning unit is a device in the Florist's Shop. The air-conditioning is fixed in place and switched on.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when in the Florist's Shop:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the air-conditioning is switched off, say &quot;You worry about the cut flowers in this jungle-hot air.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;There is an low susurration from the air-conditioning unit.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>One primary dictionary definition for a machine is &quot;an apparatus using or applying mechanical power and having several parts&quot;, and we often use the &quot;part of&quot; relationship to build machinery. <b>Control Center</b> provides a neat way to display the component parts of a machine to the player who examines it.
<p>
<p>One component almost always part of an electrical machine is the (literal) switch, lever or button to control whether they are switched on or off. In <b>Model Shop</b> just such an on/off button is automatically made part of every device.
<p>
<p>While an electrical device has only two states, a mechanical machine might have many, and for these the best approach is to define a kind of value naming the possibilities: see <b>Signs and Portents</b>, where the states are the possible destinations pointed towards.
<p>
<p>Perhaps stretching the definition of &quot;machine&quot;, <b>What Makes You Tick</b> demonstrates a fishing pole which the player can put together from several pieces.
