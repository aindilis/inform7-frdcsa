<p>
<p>Some things will occasionally be in a limbo state called being &quot;off-stage&quot;: like actors or props not needed in Act II, but perhaps to be brought back on-stage later, they wait on the sidelines. Anything created with no apparent location will start the game off-stage, as in the case of the lamp here:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Aladdin's Cave is a room. The genie's lamp is a container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Such things are easy to see in the World index because they are listed after all of the rooms and their contents, not belonging inside any room.)
<p>
<p>To move something back on-stage, we simply &quot;move&quot; it back onto the stage set, so to speak: back to a room, or into, onto, or made part of something else which is currently on-stage. To remove something, we use the phrase:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>remove </b>(object)<b> from play</b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_remove -->

<p>Removes the given object from play, so that it is not present in any room. We are not permitted to remove rooms, or doors, or the player, from play; but we are permitted to remove backdrops, making them disappear from all rooms in which they are present. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">remove the gold coin from play;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p> We can test whether something is on-stage or off-stage with:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the gold coin is on-stage, ...
<br>if the gold coin is off-stage, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>or could, for instance, write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;Ah, so many absent friends. Who now remembers [list of off-stage people]?&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can even write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now the gold coin is off-stage
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which is equivalent the &quot;remove the gold coin from play&quot;, and similarly for on-stage. (If we say &quot;now the gold coin is on-stage&quot; and it already was, nothing happens; if it wasn't, it is moved to the current location.)
<p>
<p>&quot;On-stage&quot; and &quot;off-stage&quot; are adjectives, like &quot;visible&quot; or &quot;touchable&quot;, and they apply only to things. Rooms, directions and regions are the stage itself: so it makes no sense to ask the question of whether they are &quot;on-&quot; or &quot;off-&quot;. Doors are always on-stage; backdrops are on-stage unless they have been explicitly removed using the &quot;remove... from play&quot; phrase.

<a name="e132"><a href=doc131.html#e132 STYLE="text-decoration: none">**<b><b>Example</b> 124:  Extra Supplies</b></a><br>A supply of red pens from which the player can take another pen only if he doesn't already have one somewhere in the game world.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we have a supply closet in our game from which the player is allowed to take red pens. To keep modeling simple, we only allow him to have one in play at a time, and we test this by seeing whether the red pen is &quot;off-stage&quot; before moving it to his possession.
<p>
<p>This approach might seem no different from having a single red pen sitting in the closet, but it may be preferable, for two reasons. First, it's not very plausible for a supply closet to contain nothing but a single red pen (well, assuming a well-regulated supplier, anyway); and second, it gives the player a way to get a new red pen should the original be destroyed in a tragic handwriting accident.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Extra Supplies&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Supply Closet is a room. A supply of red pens is in the Supply Closet. Understand &quot;pen&quot; as the supply of red pens when the red pen is not visible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">There is a red pen.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking the supply of red pens:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the red pen is off-stage:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the red pen to the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You help yourself to a fresh red pen.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You're only allowed one pen at a time. The department secretary is very strict.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">South of the Supply Closet is the Furnace Room. The incinerator is a thing in the Furnace Room. It is a container. &quot;The incinerator is here, working full blast.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After inserting something into the incinerator:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the noun from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;A fiery blast consumes [the noun]!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;get pen / i / get pen / get supply / s / put pen in incinerator / n / get pen&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
