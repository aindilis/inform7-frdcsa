Liquids</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Liquids are notoriously difficult to simulate well. A fully thorough approach consumes endless storage and can be very finicky to write and keep realistic. It is essential to decide what aspect of a liquid's behaviour is actually needed in a given story, and to simulate only that. For instance, if we only need a little chemistry, where a player can add (say) water to salt and make a solution, we do not want to fool around with calculating quantities or concentrations: what's important is that &quot;some water&quot; (amount unspecified) combines with &quot;some salt&quot; to produce &quot;some salty water&quot;. We should no more calculate precisely here than we would work out where all the furniture is to the nearest inch. Good advice for handling liquids is to simulate the least amount of realism possible, but no less.
<p>
<p>Sometimes all we want is a down-in-one drink: we needn't simulate the actual liquid, just the bottle it comes in, and all we need is to handle the &quot;drinking&quot; action. See <b>Beverage Service</b>, and also <b>3 AM</b>, where carbonated drinks can be shaken - again simulating the vessel, not the liquid.
<p>
<p>Some elementary biochemistry in <b>Xylan</b> is done simply by... well, the point is that two different liquids are represented by single things each, and a chemical reaction simply switches one for the other.
<p>
<p>In <b>Frizz</b>, we allow any container to be filled (only) with water (only) and we simulate what happens to any solid objects also inside: some waterproof, some not. <b>Flotation</b> provides a well (always full of water), with rules to determine whether things dropped into it should sink or float.
<p>
<p>Next we move up to quantitative approaches, where we remember not just whether a liquid is present, but how much of it. In its simplest form, we could have a drinking vessel from which we draw in sips, so that it can be full, half-empty or empty: see <b>Thirst</b>.
<p>
<p>The example with the best compromise between simulation quality and complexity is <b>Lemonade</b>. Here we provide a kind of container called a &quot;fluid container&quot;, not just a single cup, and each such vessel has a given &quot;fluid capacity&quot;. Each holds only a single liquid at a time (so no mixtures) and can be empty or full to any level (rounded off to the nearest 0.1 fl oz). We can fill one vessel from another (unless it would make a mixture). But liquids leaving these vessels must be consumed - drunk or poured away without trace: we cannot make pools on the floor, or carry liquids in our cupped hands. There is no object representing &quot;lemonade&quot;: there are only fluid containers, but which can be called LEMONADE if that is what they now contain.
<p>
<p><b>Savannah</b> is a light elaboration of Lemonade, showing how liquids might be poured on other objects, as for instance to extinguish a fire.
<p>
<p><b>Noisy Cricket</b> extends <b>Lemonade</b> to allow for mixing, though then the number of different possible mixtures is so large that complexity increases greatly. <b>Lakeside Living</b> extends <b>Lemonade</b> differently to add a &quot;liquid source&quot; kind, a form of fluid container which has infinite fluid capacity and is scenery - ideal for a lake, river or spring.

<p>
<p>Here we want a rulebook to determine whether objects float or sink, so we create an object-based rulebook for the purpose. The more specific rules here, pertaining to corks and to inflated things, will be consulted first; then, as a default, the general flotation rule.
<p>
<p>We also want a switch that can turn flotation off at will. The rule about the big switch will be observed before the others because the when... clause makes it more specific than the other rules in the flotation rulebook.
<p>
<p>If we wanted, we could also put these rules into a rulebook in an explicit order, overriding Inform's automatic sorting by specificity.

<p>

<br>A flotation rule when the big switch is switched on: rule fails.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After inserting something into the well:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider the flotation rules for the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the rule succeeded:

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be sinking, rising, or static. A thing is usually static.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is wet:

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if something is sinking, say &quot;[The list of sinking things] sink[if the number of sinking things is 1]s[end if] out of sight.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And finally a few description rules to make things look prettier:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about the well when the well contains something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The chief feature of the room is a concrete-sided well in which there float[if the number of things in the well is 1]s[end if] [a list of things in the well].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about the well:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The chief feature of the room is a concrete-sided well full of water.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As we recall from the chapter on activities, &quot;writing a paragraph about...&quot; is an activity; activities are themselves structured as sets of object-based rulebooks. The activity &quot;writing a paragraph about&quot; uses three object-based rulebooks (before writing..., for writing..., after writing...). We could have made a flotation activity as well, but in general it is overkill to make an activity to make success/failure decisions. For that purpose an object-based rulebook is sufficient.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;get all / put cork in well / put ring in well / put ingot in well / x well / get cork / get ring / switch switch on / put cork in well / put ring in well / x well / switch switch off / switch switch on&quot;.
