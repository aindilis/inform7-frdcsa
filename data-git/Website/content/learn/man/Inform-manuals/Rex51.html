<p>&quot;Disenchantment Bay&quot; is a simple work of IF used as a running example in Chapter 3 of <i>Writing with Inform</i> - not so much a tutorial as a convenient hook on which to hang some demonstrations of the basics. Because the resulting examples only use basic features and in the most straightforward way, they make for uninteresting &quot;recipes&quot; - so they are not included in the <i>Recipe Book</i> proper. But some readers might like to have all twelve stages of the example gathered on a single page: this is that page.

<a name="e48"><a href=Rex48.html#e48 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b>Example 13: Disenchantment Bay 1</b></a><br>A running example in this chapter, Disenchantment Bay, involves chartering a boat. This is the first step: creating the cabin.<p>
<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e51"><a href=Rdoc3.html#e51 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 15: Disenchantment Bay 2</b></a><br>Disenchantment Bay: creating some of the objects in the cabin's description.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>If we compile our last version of the cabin, we get a room where the glass case and the bench are listed separately from the room description, even though they have already been mentioned once. We can prevent this by making the already-mentioned things scenery:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Disenchantment Bay&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Cabin is a room.  &quot;The front of the small cabin is entirely occupied with navigational instruments, a radar display, and radios for calling back to shore. Along each side runs a bench with faded blue vinyl cushions, which can be lifted to reveal the storage space underneath. A glass case against the wall contains several fishing rods.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Scratched windows offer a view of the surrounding bay, and there is a door south to the deck. A sign taped to one wall announces the menu of tours offered by the Yakutat Charter Boat Company.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Cabin contains a glass case. In the glass case is a collection of fishing rods. The case is closed, transparent, and openable. The case is scenery.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The bench is in the cabin. On the bench are some blue vinyl cushions. The bench is enterable and scenery. The cushions are scenery.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is a good idea to recognize the player's attempts to interact with any objects mentioned in the room description, so we should also provide
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Some navigational instruments, some scratched windows, a sign, a radar display, and some radios are scenery in the cabin.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;examine instruments / x windows / x sign / x display / x radios&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The door and the view will need to be done as well, but they are special cases which we will get to shortly.
<p>
<p>As noted, making something scenery also means that the player will be prevented from picking it up and carrying it away. This is sensible, though: if an object can be removed from the room where it first appears, we should be careful about mentioning it in the main room description; otherwise, it will continue to be described as present even when someone has carried it off.
