<p>
<p>Though we have blurred over this point so far, each rule must ordinarily end with one of three outcomes: success, failure and neither (&quot;no outcome&quot;).
<p>
<p>When a rulebook is followed, what happens is that each of its rules is followed in turn <b>until one of them ends in success or failure</b> - if ever: it is possible that each rule is tried and each ends with no outcome, so that the rulebook simply runs out of rules to try.
<p>
<p>For some rulebooks, these are not useful ideas: &quot;every turn&quot; rules, for instance, never produce an outcome, which is why the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook always runs through all its rules at the end of each turn. But for other rulebooks, such as &quot;check taking&quot;, it's important that a rule which fails will stop the whole rulebook. For instance, we might find that the &quot;can't take yourself rule&quot; produces no outcome (because we aren't trying to do that), and then likewise the &quot;can't take other people rule&quot; (ditto) but that the &quot;can't take component parts rule&quot; prints up a complaint, and fails the action: the rulebook stops, and never goes on to (for instance) the &quot;can't take scenery rule&quot;. This is good, because an impossible action often fails for several reasons at once, and we only want to print up one objection, not a whole list.
<p>
<p>To follow the working of this mechanism, we need to be able to predict the outcome of any given rule. Sometimes this is easy to spot. For instance, in a rule which works on actions:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">continue the action; <i>means</i> &quot;end this rule with no outcome&quot;
<br>stop the action; <i>means</i> &quot;end this rule in failure&quot;
<br>... instead; <i>means</i> &quot;end this rule in failure&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(&quot;Success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot; are technical terms here: they do not mean that the player has or hasn't got what he wanted.) This is why the rule:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before taking something: say &quot;The sentry won't let you!&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>ends in failure, and therefore stops the &quot;before&quot; rulebook. Another easy-to-spot case is when a rule makes use of the explicit phrases:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>rule succeeds</b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_succeeds -->

<p>This causes the current rule to end immediately, with its outcome considered to be a success. That means the rulebook being worked through will also end, and also be a success.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>rule fails</b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_fails -->

<p>This causes the current rule to end immediately, with its outcome considered to be a failure. That means the rulebook being worked through will also end, and also be a failure.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>make no decision</b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_nodecision -->

<p>This causes the current rule to end immediately, but with no outcome. That means the rulebook being worked through will continue to run on, beginning with the next rule.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>But what happens if a rule simply doesn't say whether it succeeds, fails or has no outcome? In that case <b>it depends on the rulebook</b>. For almost all rulebooks, a rule which doesn't make a choice has no outcome, as in the following example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before taking something: say &quot;The sentry looks at you anxiously!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This rule, if it takes effect, ends with no outcome - so the action continues. But other rulebooks have a different convention: the most important is &quot;instead&quot;, where a rule making no explicit choice is deemed to end in failure. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking something: say &quot;The sentry prods you with his rifle!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This rule, if it takes effect, ends in failure and therefore stops the action.
<p>
<p>We call this the <b>default outcome</b> of a rulebook. The default outcome of &quot;before&quot; (and of almost all rulebooks, in fact) is no outcome; the default outcome of &quot;instead&quot; is failure; the default outcome of &quot;after&quot; is success. The few exceptional cases with default outcome success or failure are marked as such in the Rules index.
<p>
<p>When we create a rulebook, it will default to &quot;no outcome&quot;. But we can specify otherwise with sentences like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The cosmic analysis rules are a rulebook. The cosmic analysis rules have default failure.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Finally, note that the default outcome for a rulebook is really the default outcome for any rule in that rulebook: if no rules in the rulebook ever apply, for instance if there aren't any and the rulebook is empty, then the rulebook ends with no outcome at all.
<p>
<p>We can test the latest outcome like so:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><i>if</i> <b>rule succeeded</b><i>:</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_succeeded -->

<p>This condition is true if the most recently followed rule ended in success. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">follow the hypothetical clever rule;
<br>if rule succeeded:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><i>if</i> <b>rule failed</b><i>:</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_failed -->

<p>This condition is true if the most recently followed rule ended in failure. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">follow the hypothetical clever rule;
<br>if rule failed:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that this is not the opposite of &quot;rule succeeded&quot;, because there's a third possibility: that it ended with no outcome.
