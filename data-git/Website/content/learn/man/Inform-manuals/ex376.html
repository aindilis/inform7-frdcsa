Totals</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>This chapter began by mentioning arithmetic, and then went on a long diversion to create scientific units, everyday weights and measures, and other notational conveniences. Putting all of that together, it's time now to calculate something with all of these numerical quantities.
<p>
<p>Suppose we invent the idea of weight, and give everything a weight of its own. Most items will have a nominal weight of 1kg, but people will be heavier. Going on actuarial tables, we might say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A weight is a kind of value. 10kg specifies a weight. Everything has a weight. A thing usually has weight 1kg. A man usually has weight 80kg. A woman usually has weight 67kg.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: A thing is light if its weight is 3kg or less.
<br>Definition: A thing is heavy if its weight is 10kg or more.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and this provides us with &quot;lighter&quot;, &quot;lightest&quot;, &quot;heavier&quot; and &quot;heaviest&quot; as before. Now we could say &quot;if Peter is heavier than Paul&quot;, or even &quot;if Peter is heavier than 75kg&quot;, and so forth. We need one more tool:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>total </b>(arithmetic values valued property)<b> of </b>(description of values)<b></b> ... <i>value</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_total -->

<p>This phrase produces the total of some property held by all of the values matching the description. A problem message is produced if the values in question can't have that property (&quot;the total carrying capacity of scenes&quot;), or if it holds a kind of value which can't meaningfully be added up (&quot;the total description of open doors&quot;). Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">total carrying capacity of people in the Deep Pool
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>That gives us everything we need for a working balance platform:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The balance platform is a supporter in the Weighbridge. &quot;The balance platform is currently weighing [the list of things on the platform]. The scale alongside reads: [total weight of things on the platform].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that this only works because we said that &quot;everything has a weight&quot;: otherwise it would make no sense to add up the weights of things.
<p>
<p>This enables us to get the average weight of a group of things, too:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the total weight of things on the platform divided by the number of things on the platform
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But we should be careful that this does not accidentally divide by zero, which it will if the platform has nothing on it! As well as the average, we could find the maximum and minimum weights:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the weight of the heaviest thing on the platform
<br>the weight of the lightest thing on the platform
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We should remember that &quot;the heaviest thing on the platform&quot; may be ambiguous, because there may be several equally heavy things there. That means
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the lead pig is the heaviest thing on the platform
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will only reliably work if there is no possibility of a tie. A safer bet is:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the lead pig is the weight of the heaviest thing on the platform
</font></blockquote><p>

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e376"><a href=doc236.html#e376 STYLE="text-decoration: none">***<b><b>Example</b> 251:  Nickel and Dimed</b></a><br>A more intricate system of money, this time keeping track of the individual denominations of coins and bills, specifying what gets spent at each transaction, and calculating appropriate change.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Typically games which keep track of the player's wealth need only do so as an abstract number, but occasionally it becomes useful to represent money as physical coins and bills. Here is an example that does exactly that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Nickel and Dimed&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 1 - Currency
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Price is a kind of value. $10.99 specifies a price with parts dollars and cents. A thing has a price. The price of a thing is usually $0.00.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Money is a kind of thing. Coin is a kind of money.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dollar bill is a kind of money. The price of a dollar bill is $1.00. The printed name of a dollar bill is &quot;dollar bill&quot;. Rule for printing the plural name of a dollar bill: say &quot;dollar bills&quot;. The description of a dollar bill is &quot;It has George Washington's head on the front, which with a bit of creative folding can be scrunched to look like a mushroom. All important things really are learned in kindergarten.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A five-dollar bill is a kind of money. The price of a five-dollar bill is $5.00. Understand &quot;five&quot; or &quot;five dollar&quot; as the five-dollar bill. The description of a five-dollar bill is &quot;Abraham Lincoln. He looks slightly less dignified here than he does on the penny.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hundred-dollar bill is a kind of money. The price of the hundred-dollar bill is $100.00. Understand &quot;hundred&quot; or &quot;hundred dollar&quot; as the hundred-dollar bill. Understand &quot;dollar&quot; as the dollar bill. The description of a hundred-dollar bill is &quot;It's got Benjamin Franklin, who always gets shafted: a denomination too large for anyone to carry conveniently, and a lot of local fame in Philadelphia.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Our choice of understand rules guarantees that &quot;five dollar&quot; will be understood as the five, but &quot;dollar&quot; alone as the single. We will learn more about &quot;understand&quot; in later chapters, but here is a test to check the functionality:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test bills with &quot;x hundred dollar bill / x five dollar bill / x hundred / x five / x dollar / x dollar bill&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A quarter is a kind of coin. The price of a quarter is $0.25. The description of a quarter is &quot;One of the old-fashioned variety, not a state quarter.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dime is a kind of coin. The price of a dime is $0.10. The description of a dime is &quot;Franklin Roosevelt, trying not to look too annoyed that his coin is so small and thin.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A nickel is a kind of coin. The price of a nickel is $0.05. The description of a nickel is &quot;A chubby coin, but you've always liked Thomas Jefferson, and the Monticello on the back is a nice touch.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A penny is a kind of coin. The price of a penny is $0.01. The description of the penny is &quot;A profile of Abe Lincoln. Sometime soon they'll stop minting these, you're sure of it.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 2 - Ownership
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Ownership relates one person (called the owner) to various things. The verb to own (he owns, they own, he owned, he is owned) implies the ownership relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is owned if the player owns it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of buying something which is owned by the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You already own [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going somewhere when the player encloses something (called the stolen goods) which is not owned by the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the owner of the stolen goods is not a person:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player owns the stolen goods;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the owner of the stolen goods can see the player,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'Hey there buddy, not so fast,' says [the owner of the stolen goods]. 'You going to buy [the stolen goods] first, or am I gonna call the cops?'&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise continue the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After taking inventory:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Altogether, you've got [the player's cash] on your person.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what price is the player's cash:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let sum be the total price of money enclosed by the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on sum.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what price is the sum in (item - a container):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let sum be the total price of the money in the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on sum.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: now every thing carried by the player is owned by the player.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 3 - Purchasing and Sales
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is worthless if the price of it is $0.00. Definition: a thing is valuable if it is not worthless.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be for sale.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing room description details of something (called target) which is for sale (this is the disclose prices in room description rule): say &quot; ([price of the target])&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before listing contents: group money together giving articles.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining a for sale thing (this is the describe things by price rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] costs [the price of the noun], payable to [the owner of the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The cashbox is a theoretical construct, not something the player will ever encounter in the course of the game. It contains all the money that is available for non-player characters to use in making change. If we wanted, we could give each character his own stash of change, but this would increase the likelihood that any given person would run out of cash to make change with. (And in this example there is only one vendor anyway.)
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The cashbox is a container. The cashbox contains 10 pennies. The cashbox contains 10 nickels.  The cashbox contains 10 dimes.  The cashbox contains 10 quarters.  The cashbox contains 10 dollar bills.  The cashbox contains 10 five-dollar bills.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The block buying rule is not listed in the check buying rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check buying something:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's cash is less than the price of the noun, say &quot;You can't afford the asking price of [the price of the noun] for [the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out buying something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let sum paid be $0.00;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while sum paid is less than the price of the noun:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let bill offered be the best money from the player for the current target;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the bill offered is money:

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Money can be spent or fresh.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report buying something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player owns the noun,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Your transaction is now complete, leaving you with [the player's cash].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We've skipped over defining what makes a denomination the best for a given transaction, so we'd better do that now. Our goal is to avoid ever having the player gratuitously overpay -- he should always offer the smallest amount of money that will meet the price of what he's buying.
<p>
<p>We also assume that all money &quot;enclosed by the buyer&quot; -- that is, somewhere in the buyer's possession -- is available for use. This might not be true in a game where the player could pick up, say, a sealed lucite container with a ten-dollar bill inside; in that case we would have to define our terms more rigorously, perhaps by requiring that the bills be both enclosed and touchable by the buyer. The touchability check adds an extra layer of calculation, however, and since it is not necessary in this example (and probably not in most other cases either), we'll leave it out:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: money is costly if its price is $2.50 or more. Definition: money is cheap if its price is $0.99 or less.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Functional relation is a kind of value. The functional relations are overpayment, underpayment, or irrelevant. Money has a functional relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what money is the best money from (buyer - a thing) for (cost - a price):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with bill offered running through money:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the bill offered is enclosed by the buyer:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the price of the bill offered is the cost, decide on the bill offered;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the price of the bill offered is greater than the cost, now the functional relation of bill offered is overpayment;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise now the functional relation of the bill offered is underpayment;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the functional relation of the bill offered is irrelevant;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[say &quot;underpayment: [a list of underpayment money]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overpayment: [a list of overpayment money]&quot;;]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the total price of underpayment money is less than the cost:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on the cheapest money which is overpayment;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on the costliest money which is underpayment.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Notice the &quot;say underpayment/overpayment section...&quot; noted out, above. This is for debugging purposes: when writing complex code, it is sometimes useful to put in lines that will say explicitly what is going on. We can enclose them in brackets and Inform will ignore them as though they were comments; if we run into any problems with the code later, we can erase the brackets and see the diagnostic printed to the screen as we play.
