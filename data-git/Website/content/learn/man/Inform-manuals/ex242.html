Report rules for actions by other people</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Report rules for the player's actions are easy to write, and for many actions, they are not much harder for other people either:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report photographing: say &quot;Click!&quot;
<br>Report someone photographing: say &quot;Click! [The person asked] takes a snapshot of [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But once other people are involved, we have to go to some trouble to get all of the possibilities right. Here is a case which did not immediately occur to the author of the &quot;going&quot; action, for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>get in cage
<br>You get into the cage.
<br>>clark, get in automobile
<br>Clark Gable gets into the automobile.
<br>>clark, push cage west
<br>Clark Gable goes west in the automobile, pushing the cage in front, and you along too.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><b>The Lot</b> (in the cage)
<br>In the Lot you can see an automobile (in which is Clark Gable).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We said before that report rules are skipped if the action is running &quot;silently&quot;, or if the action is one that the player does not witness. But that is also a tricky concept. Inform's doctrine is that you witness an action if you can see any of the actor, the noun or the second noun at either the beginning or the end of the action; except that being able to see a backdrop does not count. Thus if Clark Gable, in Beverly Hills, photographs the Hollywood sign then we do not witness this from Sunset Boulevard merely because we, too, can see the Hollywood sign.
<p>
<p>While the report rules for actions by the player must actually report something, report rules for other people's actions are under no such obligation. For instance, if Clark unlocks a door from the other side to the player, then this counts as an action that the player witnesses - and after all, it could be argued that the player should hear the key turning in the lock - but in fact the standard rules for reporting locking choose to say nothing.

<p>
<p>One of the nice things about before rules for actions is that they allow us to express some planning for characters other than the player: we've already seen how this works, a bit. But we could also use before rules to write plans for an abstract story-driving entity, rather than for other individual characters. This story-driver could be in charge of all the non-player characters, as well as spontaneous or natural changes in the environment, shaping the narrative around the player's behavior.
<p>
<p>The following example is a very simple one, but the same concept could be worked out in a great deal more complexity, with all sorts of alternative procedures available to our story-manager:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Fate Steps In&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Fate is a woman. After deciding the scope of the player: place Fate in scope. The description of Fate is &quot;Not smiling.&quot; Instead of doing something other than examining to fate: say &quot;As if.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn: try fate tripping.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Tripping is an action applying to nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out someone tripping:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if something dangerous (called the trap) is in the location:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Lise chooses this moment to lick her fingers -- it's not gross, it's natural, you decide -- stand up, and head for the door. Unfortunately, her path crosses directly over [the trap]. There is a vaudevillesque moment where you try to warn or catch her; the next moment she's on the floor, looking shocked and also in quite a lot of pain. 'I'm not sure,' she says to you steadily but with unfocused gaze, 'but I think I might have broken my tailbone.'&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the story saying &quot;Well, she's paying attention to you now&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before someone tripping when the location does not contain a dangerous thing: try the person asked making a mess instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Making a mess is an action applying to nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out someone making a mess:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let calamitous object be a random visible supporter which supports at least three things;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if calamitous object is a supporter:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The calamitous object] tips over, spilling [the list of things on calamitous object] all over the place.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the calamitous object to the location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every thing on the calamitous object is in the location.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is dangerous if it is not the carton and it is not the table and it is not a person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before someone making a mess when a safe supporter (called target) is visible:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Lise carries something, try Lise putting a random thing carried by Lise on the target instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of someone making a mess when the tray is on the table:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Just at that moment, a large blond man-thing in a red jacket walks more or less through you, and you come into violent contact with the table, knocking [the list of the things on the table] onto the floor.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every thing on the table is in the location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every thing on the tray is in the location instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a supporter is safe if the number of things on it is less than two.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">McQuerry Dining Hall is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The table is scenery in the dining hall. The table is a supporter.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Lise Fitzwallace is a woman in the Dining Hall. &quot;Lise is at the nearest table, not apparently paying any attention to you.&quot; The description of Lise is &quot;A capella singer, women's rugby champion, general object of attention from all genders. Unlikely to notice you unless fate smiles broadly.&quot; Lise carries a fork, a napkin, an empty glass, and a plate of half-eaten eggplant parmesan.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report Lise putting something on something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Lise, still deep in thought, absently puts [the noun] on [the second noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The carrying capacity of the player is 2. The carton of chocolate milk is in the Hall. &quot;There's a carton of milk beside you, which you set down for a moment -- but you do want it.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking something when the player carries the tray:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You've got both hands full with this tray.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries the tray. On the tray is some macaroni and some overdone chicken. The macaroni and the chicken are edible. The tray is portable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;get milk / put tray on table / get milk&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test again with &quot;drop tray&quot;.
