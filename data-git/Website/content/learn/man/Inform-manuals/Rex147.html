<p>These three examples simply show what can be done using Inform's EPS-format map output, if one is willing to tweak the design in some vector-art program. Unfortunately, at present, there are few alternatives to Adobe Illustrator - a superb but very expensive program - in the field of EPS editing, and indeed, of vector art generally: this is especially the case for Windows users. But for the IF author who does happen to have Illustrator for some other reason, Inform plays nicely with it.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e147"><a href=Rdoc103.html#e147 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 435:  Baedeker</b></a><br>Creating a floorplan of the cathedral using the locations from previous examples.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>If our map is largely or entirely set inside a single building, we might want to produce something that resembles a floorplan. It's possible to do this with a little tweaking, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Baedeker&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Dome is a room. North of Dome is North Chapel. South of the Dome is South Chapel. West of the Dome is Western End. Quiet Corner is northwest of the Dome, north of Western End, and west of North Chapel. Loud Corner is east of North Chapel, northeast of Dome, and north of Eastern End. Eastern End is north of Dim Corner and east of Dome. Dim Corner is southeast of Dome and east of South Chapel. Ruined Corner is southwest of Dome, west of South Chapel, and south of Western End.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The church door is east of Eastern End and west of the Courtyard. The church door is a door.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Index map with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-shape set to &quot;square&quot; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-size set to 60 and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-name-size set to 9 and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-name-length set to 13 and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;route-thickness set to 20 and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-outline set to off and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;map-outline set to off and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;route-colour set to &quot;White&quot; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-colour set to &quot;White&quot; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-shape of Dome set to &quot;circle&quot; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-size of Dome set to 80 and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EPS file.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we have a map made of white lines and boxes over a white background, which is not very exciting. If, however, we put a layer of black under this and slightly adjust the room shapes (using an image editor such as Adobe Illustrator), we can produce something that plausibly resembles a floorplan or museum map, like so:
<p>
<p><img border=0 src=images/Sophia.jpg>
