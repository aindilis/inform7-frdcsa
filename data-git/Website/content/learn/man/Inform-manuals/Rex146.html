<p>
<p>Making the printed text adapt to circumstances only makes half of the conversation graceful: the other half is to allow the player's commands to have a similar freedom. The things the player can refer to should always respond to the names which would seem natural to the player. Inform provides a variety of techniques for understanding words always, or only under certain conditions; and, if need be, we can also get direct access to what the player has typed in order to examine it with regular expressions. (This last resort is rarely necessary.)
<p>
<p><b>First Name Basis</b> shows how to assign names to things or to kinds of thing - if, for instance, we want the player to be able to refer to any man as &quot;man&quot; or &quot;gentleman&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;man&quot; or &quot;gentleman&quot; as a man.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We may also sometimes want to give names that are specifically plural, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A duck is a kind of animal. Understand &quot;birds&quot; as the plural of duck.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>or
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;birds&quot; as the plural of the magpie.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p><b>Vouvray</b> demonstrates.
<p>
<p>A common challenge arises when two objects have names that overlap or are related, and we wish Inform to choose sensibly between them: for instance, a cigarette vs. a cigarette case. If a word should apply to something only as part of a phrase (e.g., &quot;cigarette&quot; alone should never refer to the cigarette case) we can manage the situation as follows:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The case is a closed openable container. The printed name is &quot;cigarette case&quot;. Understand &quot;cigarette case&quot; as the case.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Because &quot;cigarette&quot; here appears only as part of the phrase &quot;cigarette case&quot;, it will be understood only in that context; the conflict with the bare cigarette will not arise.
<p>
<p>As a variant, we may want one object only to take precedence over another in naming. If we wanted the player to be allowed to refer casually to the cigarette case as &quot;cigarette&quot; when (and only when) the cigarette itself is not in view, we could add
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;cigarette&quot; as the case when the cigarette is not visible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Tricks which consider the visibility of other objects can be bad for performance if used widely; but for adding finesse to the treatment of a few items, they work very well.
<p>
<p>(There may still arise cases where the player uses a name which can legitimately refer to two different things in view. To deal with this situation, we may want the Does the player mean... rules, explained in the chapter on Understanding; and to change the way the game asks for clarification, see the two activities Asking which do you mean and Clarifying the parser's choice of something.)
<p>
<p>Names of things which contain prepositions can also be tricky because Inform misreads the sentences creating them: <b>Laura</b> shows how some awkward cases can be safely overcome.
<p>
<p>A more difficult case is to ensure that if we change the description or nature of something in play, then the names we understand for it adapt, too. &quot;Understand... when...&quot; can be all that's needed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;king&quot; as Aragorn when we have crowned Aragorn.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Or, similarly, if we want some combination of categories and characteristics to be recognized:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;giant&quot; as a man when the item described is tall.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;The item described&quot; here refers to the thing being named. &quot;...when&quot; can even be useful in defining new commands, and <b>Quiz Show</b> demonstrates how to ask open-ended questions that the player can answer only on the subsequent turn.
<p>
<p>Properties can also be matched without fuss:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Tint is a kind of value. The tints are green, aquamarine and darkish purple. The wallpaper is fixed in place in the H√¥tel. The wallpaper has a tint. Understand the tint property as describing the wallpaper.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This allows EXAMINE AQUAMARINE WALLPAPER if, but only if, it happens to be aquamarine at the moment. Relationships can also be matched automatically:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A box is a kind of container. The red box is a box in the Toyshop. Some crayons are in the red box. Understand &quot;box of [something related by containment]&quot; as a box.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which recognises BOX OF CRAYONS until they are removed, when it reverts to plain BOX only.
<p>
<p>Greater difficulty arises if, using some variable or property or table to mark that a bottle contains wine, we print messages calling it &quot;bottle of wine&quot;. We are then honour-bound to understand commands like TAKE BOTTLE OF WINE in return, not to insist on TAKE BOTTLE. Almost all &quot;simulation&quot; IF runs in to issues like this, and there is no general solution because simulations are so varied.
<p>
<p>A converse challenge arises when we want to <i>avoid</i> understanding the player's references to an object under some or all circumstances. This is relatively uncommon, but does sometimes occur. For this situation, Inform provides the &quot;privately-named&quot; property, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The unrecognizable object is a privately-named thing in the Kitchen.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here &quot;privately-named&quot; tells Inform not to understand the object's source name automatically. It is then up to us to create any understand lines we want to refer to the object, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;oyster fork&quot; as the unrecognizable object when the etiquette book is read.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Of course, if we need an object that the player is never allowed to refer to at all, we can just make this privately-named and then not provide any understand lines at all.
<p>
<p>A final source of difficulty is that by default Inform truncates words to nine letters before attempting to identify them. This is no problem in most circumstances and is likely to go unnoticed -- until we have two very long words whose names are nearly identical, such as &quot;north-northwest exit&quot; and &quot;north-northeast exit&quot;. (To make matters worse, a punctuation mark such as a hyphen counts as two letters on its own.)
<p>
<p>When we are compiling for Glulx, the limit is easily changed with a single line, setting the constant called DICT_WORD_SIZE. For instance, if we wanted to raise the limit to 15, we would write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use DICT_WORD_SIZE of 15.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>When compiling for the Z-machine, the solution is harder. <b>North by Northwest</b> shows how to use the reading a command activity to pre-process very long names, rendering them accessible to the parser again.
<p>
<p>Inform also allows the player to refer to the most recently seen objects and people as IT, HIM, HER, and so on. It sets these pronouns by default, but there are times when we wish to override the way it does that. <b>Pot of Petunias</b> shows off a way to make Inform recognize an object as IT when it would not otherwise have done so.

<p>
<p>Sometimes we create objects that we want the player to be able to call by different names: a television that should also answer to &quot;tv&quot; and &quot;telly&quot;, for instance, or a refrigerator the player might also call &quot;fridge&quot;. In this case, we can use instructions like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;tv&quot; and &quot;telly&quot; as the television.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>to add extra names to the object we've defined.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;First Name Basis&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Crew Lounge is a room. &quot;Deliberately spartan: the crew feels weight restrictions here first, so there aren't any chairs, just a few thin pads on the ground.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The holographic projector is a device in the Crew Lounge. &quot;The one major source of entertainment is the holographic projector, a top of the line Misthon 9000, on which you view every beam you can get.&quot; Understand &quot;holo&quot; or &quot;holograph&quot; or &quot;Misthon&quot; or &quot;9000&quot; as the projector.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the projector is &quot;[if switched on]The projector is now playing a documentary about the early politics of the Mars colony.[otherwise]The air above the projector is disappointingly clear.[end if]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(This description is for local color; we will learn more about devices, and conditions like &quot;if switched on&quot;, later in this chapter.)
<p>
<p>By default, Inform does not understand the names of an object's kind as referring to that object, unless the object has no other name of its own. We can change this, if we like, by defining names that should be applied to everything of a given kind:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Lewis and Harper are men in the Crew Lounge. Understand &quot;man&quot; or &quot;guy&quot; or &quot;chap&quot; or &quot;lad&quot; or &quot;male&quot; as a man. Understand &quot;men&quot; or &quot;chaps&quot; or &quot;lads&quot; or &quot;guys&quot; or &quot;males&quot; as the plural of a man.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of Lewis is &quot;A wiry, excitable engineer who just signed aboard last week.&quot; The description of Harper is &quot;Harper's a good guy: taciturn when sober, affectionate when drunk, but rarely annoying in either state.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x holo / x man / lewis / x guy / harper / turn on projector / x holo projector / get men&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform's naming abilities go considerably further, in fact: we can also instruct it to understand words only under certain circumstances, or only when they appear with other words. Fuller details may be found in the chapter on Understanding.
