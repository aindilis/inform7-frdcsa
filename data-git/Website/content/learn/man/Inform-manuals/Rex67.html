Money</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Money could be anything which the two people in a bargain both agree is valuable. Here, the player and an ogre agree on a copper coin as money:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a copper coin. The ogre carries a rock cake. The cake is edible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of giving the coin to the ogre:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the ogre carries the coin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player carries the cake;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The ogre grunts and hands you a rock cake.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now Inform does provide an action, &quot;buying&quot;, and a command for it, BUY, but they ordinarily respond simply &quot;Nothing is on sale.&quot; This is no longer true, so we should make BUY CAKE work. The difficulty here is that a command like BUY CAKE does not specify what should be handed over in exchange. Here we just check that the player has the coin, but in principle we could check for any of a range of monetary tokens - coins, notes, cheque book, debit card, and so on.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of buying the cake:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player has the coin, try giving the coin to the ogre;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;You have no money.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In more advanced economies, where shopping replaces barter, the seller will stock a wide range of differently priced goods. For a tabulated catalogue of wares, see <b>Introduction to Juggling</b>: to allow the player to negotiate prices, see <b>Money for Nothing</b>. In both of those examples, the player's current financial worth is simulated only as a current total amount of money carried - say, $2.50. This is typical, because in most situations what matters is how much money is in the pocket, not how it is made up. Money behaves more like a liquid than a set of items: hence terms like &quot;liquidity&quot;, &quot;cash flow&quot; or <b>Frozen Assets</b> - the name of the simplest example demonstrating this. If we really need a comprehensive simulation down to pieces of currency - where it makes a difference carrying four quarters rather than a dollar bill, because the quarters can be fed into a vending machine - see <b>Nickel and Dimed</b>.
<p>
<p><b>Fabrication</b> takes the problem in a different direction, making calculations about the cost of a new garment based on the price of the pattern, the quantity of fabric required, and the value of the fabric type chosen -- showing off what we can do with unit multiplication in Inform.
<p>
<p><b>Widget Enterprises</b> explores the challenge of pricing widgets for maximum profit, given certain necessary costs and customers with varying willingness to pay.

<a name="e67"><a href=Rdoc71.html#e67 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 253:  Frozen Assets</b></a><br>A treatment of money which keeps track of how much the player has on him, and a BUY command which lets him go shopping.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>In our brave new world, everything will have a price, so we had better spell this out.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Frozen Assets&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Price is a kind of value. $10.99 specifies a price. A thing has a price. The price of a thing is usually $0.00. After examining something for sale, say &quot;It can be yours for [the price of the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we assume a simple shopping model in which the player can't take anything without paying for it.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is free if the price of it is $0.00.
<br>Definition: a thing is for sale if it is not free.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking something for sale:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You'll have to pay for that.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before buying something for sale when the money is not in the wallet:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You're broke.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before buying something for sale when the money is free:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You're broke.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before buying something for sale when the price of the money is less than the price of the noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Your funds do not run to the price of [the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of buying something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decrease the price of the money by the price of the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You fork over [the price of the noun] for [the noun], leaving yourself with [the price of the money].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the money is free, remove the money from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the price of the noun is $0.00;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player is carrying the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The player's money object is going to be a bit unusual, because it has value but cannot itself be bought.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a wallet. The wallet contains money. The price of the money is $4.50. The printed name of the money is &quot;[price of the money] in cash&quot;. Understand &quot;cash&quot; as the money.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking the money:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Best to leave it alone until you need to buy something.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of buying something free:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] is yours already.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of buying the money:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The money belongs to you; you buy things with it.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we just need something to buy.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Dessert Parlor is a room. &quot;An underlit, over-crowded room campily furnished with a lot of gilt-frame mirrors and twinkle lights: it is essentially a brothel of food. The service is slow at best, and on Saturday nights glacial. However. The wares on display more than make up for these trivial inconveniences.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The vanilla ice cream is an edible thing in the Parlor. The price of the ice cream is $2.45. The description is &quot;In the scale of ice creams, you recognize this as a very inferior vanilla because it has no adjectives in the title.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The raspberry tart is an edible thing in the Parlor. The price of the tart is $4.50. The description is &quot;An almond-laced shell packed with raspberries-under-glaze.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The syllabub is an edible thing in the Parlor. The price of the syllabub is $4.25. The description is &quot;Whipped cream, alcohol, and lime juice, a substance without any redeeming food value whatever.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The espresso cake is an edible thing in the Parlor. The price of the espresso cake is $5.50. The description is &quot;A lethal wedge of purest blackness.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;inventory / examine syllabub / get syllabub / buy syllabub / drop it / get it / buy raspberry tart&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Implementing caloric units for this scenario is left as an exercise for the reader.
