<p>
<p>Occasionally we would like to change the way the name of something is printed as part of our inventory, and we can do this with a printing the name rule such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of the dead rat while taking inventory:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;dead rat (at arm's length)&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There are also several possibilities for redesigning the inventory list as a whole. <b>INVENTORY listing with separate carried and worn items</b> shows how to divide an inventory list into two parts, a &quot;You are carrying: &quot; section and a &quot;You are wearing: &quot; section. <b>Equipment List</b> goes further, and shows how we might use Inform's specialized listing functions to create a variety of differently formatted inventories.
<p>
<p>Sometimes the way Inform by default lists properties such as &quot;(closed)&quot; or &quot;(open but empty)&quot; isn't quite what we want. <b>Oyster Wide Shut</b> offers a flexible alternative to the standard behavior, allowing finer control over which properties are listed and how they are described.
<p>
<p><b>Trying Taking Manhattan</b> replaces the inventory behavior for other characters: instead of silently looking through their possessions (but not describing them to the player), they now describe to the player what they're carrying and wearing.

<p>If we wanted, we might replace the rule for taking inventory as follows:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Persephone&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking inventory:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You're carrying [a list of things carried by the player][if the player wears something]. You are wearing [a list of things worn by the player][end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Fancy Party is a room. The player carries a sword, a strawberry stem, and 20 credits worth of platinum. The player wears a sash indicating lordhood.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;i / take off sash / i&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
