<p>
<p>The &quot;language of play&quot; is the natural language used to communicate with the player at run-time: this is normally English.
<p>
<p>That means that it is difficult to write, say, Spanish-language IF using Inform 7, though heroic work by the Spanish IF community has overcome this. Inform 6 provided for translation by isolating its linguistic code in a part of the I6 library called the &quot;language definition file&quot;, which was normally &quot;English.h&quot;. Translations were gradually made to most major European languages, resulting in alternative language definition files called &quot;French.h&quot;, &quot;Italian.h&quot; and so on. Full details on how to write a language definition file were given in the Translations chapter of the DM4, that is, the fourth edition of the Inform 6 Designer's Manual.
<p>
<p>In I7 the system is different. We use the template, not a library. Instead of providing a language definition file such as &quot;French.h&quot;, a translator should create an extension called something like &quot;French by Jacques Mensonge&quot;. (The language should be named in English, so &quot;French by ...&quot;, not &quot;Fran√ßais by ...&quot;) This extension should then contain the same material as an I6 language definition file, but put in place using template hacking (see the previous section). As an example, the extension &quot;English by David Fisher&quot; is supplied with I7: using it has no effect because the language of play is already English, of course, so it is provided only as a model to copy.
<p>
<p>Translators will find that there are now more numbered messages than in I6, because the template includes messages which did not exist in the I6 library.
<p>
<p>(All of this is very much a work in progress. The authors of Inform hope to make translations easier in future builds: the features introduced in April 2008 are only a start.)
