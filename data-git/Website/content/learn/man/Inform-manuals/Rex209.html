Liquids</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Liquids are notoriously difficult to simulate well. A fully thorough approach consumes endless storage and can be very finicky to write and keep realistic. It is essential to decide what aspect of a liquid's behaviour is actually needed in a given story, and to simulate only that. For instance, if we only need a little chemistry, where a player can add (say) water to salt and make a solution, we do not want to fool around with calculating quantities or concentrations: what's important is that &quot;some water&quot; (amount unspecified) combines with &quot;some salt&quot; to produce &quot;some salty water&quot;. We should no more calculate precisely here than we would work out where all the furniture is to the nearest inch. Good advice for handling liquids is to simulate the least amount of realism possible, but no less.
<p>
<p>Sometimes all we want is a down-in-one drink: we needn't simulate the actual liquid, just the bottle it comes in, and all we need is to handle the &quot;drinking&quot; action. See <b>Beverage Service</b>, and also <b>3 AM</b>, where carbonated drinks can be shaken - again simulating the vessel, not the liquid.
<p>
<p>Some elementary biochemistry in <b>Xylan</b> is done simply by... well, the point is that two different liquids are represented by single things each, and a chemical reaction simply switches one for the other.
<p>
<p>In <b>Frizz</b>, we allow any container to be filled (only) with water (only) and we simulate what happens to any solid objects also inside: some waterproof, some not. <b>Flotation</b> provides a well (always full of water), with rules to determine whether things dropped into it should sink or float.
<p>
<p>Next we move up to quantitative approaches, where we remember not just whether a liquid is present, but how much of it. In its simplest form, we could have a drinking vessel from which we draw in sips, so that it can be full, half-empty or empty: see <b>Thirst</b>.
<p>
<p>The example with the best compromise between simulation quality and complexity is <b>Lemonade</b>. Here we provide a kind of container called a &quot;fluid container&quot;, not just a single cup, and each such vessel has a given &quot;fluid capacity&quot;. Each holds only a single liquid at a time (so no mixtures) and can be empty or full to any level (rounded off to the nearest 0.1 fl oz). We can fill one vessel from another (unless it would make a mixture). But liquids leaving these vessels must be consumed - drunk or poured away without trace: we cannot make pools on the floor, or carry liquids in our cupped hands. There is no object representing &quot;lemonade&quot;: there are only fluid containers, but which can be called LEMONADE if that is what they now contain.
<p>
<p><b>Savannah</b> is a light elaboration of Lemonade, showing how liquids might be poured on other objects, as for instance to extinguish a fire.
<p>
<p><b>Noisy Cricket</b> extends <b>Lemonade</b> to allow for mixing, though then the number of different possible mixtures is so large that complexity increases greatly. <b>Lakeside Living</b> extends <b>Lemonade</b> differently to add a &quot;liquid source&quot; kind, a form of fluid container which has infinite fluid capacity and is scenery - ideal for a lake, river or spring.

<p>
<p>Much of what follows is identical to &quot;Lemonade&quot; earlier; the new material begins at Part 2.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Lakeside Living&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A volume is a kind of value. 15.9 fl oz specifies a volume with parts ounces and tenths (optional, preamble optional).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A fluid container is a kind of container. A fluid container has a volume called a fluid capacity. A fluid container has a volume called current volume.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The fluid capacity of a fluid container is usually 12.0 fl oz. The current volume of a fluid container is usually 0.0 fl oz.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Liquid is a kind of value. The liquids are water, absinthe, and iced tea. A fluid container has a liquid.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining a fluid container:

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say (amount - a volume) in rough terms:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the amount is less than 0.5 fl oz:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;a swallow or two&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise if tenths part of amount is greater than 3 and tenths part of amount is less than 7:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let estimate be ounces part of amount;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[estimate in words] or [estimate plus 1 in words] fluid ounces&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if tenths part of amount is greater than 6, increase amount by 1.0 fl oz;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;about [ounces part of amount in words] fluid ounce[s]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before printing the name of a fluid container (called the target) while not drinking or pouring:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the target is empty:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;empty &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the name of a fluid container (called the target) while not examining or pouring:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless the target is empty:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot; of [liquid of the target]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;omit contents in listing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of inserting something into a fluid container:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The second noun] has too narrow a mouth to accept anything but liquids.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a fluid container is empty if the current volume of it is 0.0 fl oz. Definition: a fluid container is full if the current volume of it is the fluid capacity of it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;drink from [fluid container]&quot; as drinking.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of drinking a fluid container:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is empty:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;There is no more [liquid of the noun] within.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decrease the current volume of the noun by 0.2 fl oz;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the current volume of the noun is less than 0.0 fl oz, now the current volume of the noun is 0.0 fl oz;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You take a sip of [the liquid of the noun][if the noun is empty], leaving [the noun] empty[end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Part 2 - Filling
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the command &quot;fill&quot; as something new.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here we want Inform to prefer full liquid sources to other containers when it chooses an end to a player's unfinished or ambiguous command. And so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;fill [fluid container] with/from [full liquid source]&quot; as filling it with. Understand &quot;fill [fluid container] with/from [fluid container]&quot; as filling it with.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Both grammar lines point to the same ultimate outcome; the purpose of specifying both is to tell Inform to check thoroughly for full liquid sources before falling back on other fluid containers when making its decisions.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;fill [something] with/from [something]&quot; as filling it with.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Filling it with is an action applying to two things. Carry out filling it with: try pouring the second noun into the noun instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;pour [fluid container] in/into/on/onto [fluid container]&quot; as pouring it into. Understand &quot;empty [fluid container] into [fluid container]&quot; as pouring it into.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;pour [something] in/into/on/onto [something]&quot; as pouring it into. Understand &quot;empty [something] into [something]&quot; as pouring it into.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Pouring it into is an action applying to two things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check pouring it into:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is not a fluid container, say &quot;You can't pour [the noun].&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is not a fluid container, say &quot;You can't pour liquids into [the second noun].&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is the second noun, say &quot;You can hardly pour [the noun] into itself.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the liquid of the noun is not the liquid of the second noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is empty, now the liquid of the second noun is the liquid of the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;Mixing [the liquid of the noun] with [the liquid of the second noun] would give unsavory results.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is empty, say &quot;No more [liquid of the noun] remains in [the noun].&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is full, say &quot;[The second noun] cannot contain any more than it already holds.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out pouring it into:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let available capacity be the fluid capacity of the second noun minus the current volume of the second noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the available capacity is greater than the current volume of the noun, now the available capacity is the current volume of the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase the current volume of the second noun by available capacity;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decrease the current volume of the noun by available capacity.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report pouring it into:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[if the noun is empty][The noun] is now empty;[otherwise][The noun] now contains [current volume of the noun in rough terms] of [liquid of the noun]; [end if]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[the second noun] contains [current volume of the second noun in rough terms] of [liquid of the second noun][if the second noun is full], and is now full[end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the liquid property as describing a fluid container. Understand &quot;of&quot; as a fluid container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now we add our liquid source kind, which will represent lakes, absinthe fountains, and any other infinite supplies of liquid we might need. Note that 3276.7 is the largest possible number of fluid ounces available to us.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A liquid source is a kind of fluid container. A liquid source has a liquid. A liquid source is usually scenery. The fluid capacity of a liquid source is usually 3276.7 fl oz. The current volume of a liquid source is usually 3276.7 fl oz. Instead of examining a liquid source: say &quot;[The noun] is full of [liquid of the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out pouring a liquid source into something: now the current volume of the noun is 3276.7 fl oz.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We want filling things from liquid sources to work the same way as usual, with the distinction that a) the liquid source never depletes in quantity (hence the carry-out rule resetting its fullness); and b) we should report the results a bit differently as well:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After pouring a liquid source into a fluid container:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You fill [the second noun] up with [liquid of the noun] from [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>On the other hand, pouring liquids into a liquid source needs to work completely differently from pouring liquids into anything else. Let's say we're going to allow any liquid at all to be dumped into rivers and streams (environmental protections evidently are not very well-enforced in this scenario):
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of pouring a fluid container into a liquid source:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is empty, say &quot;[The noun] is already empty.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the current volume of the noun is 0.0 fl oz;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You dump out [the noun] into [the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>A couple of minor refinements:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Swimming is an action applying to nothing. Understand &quot;swim&quot; or &quot;dive&quot; as swimming.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of swimming in the presence of a liquid source:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You don't feel like a dip just now.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before inserting something into a liquid source: say &quot;[The noun] would get lost and never be seen again.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Part 3 - Scenario
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Lakeside is a room. The Lakeside swing is an enterable supporter in the Lakeside. &quot;Here you are by the lake, enjoying a summery view.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The glass is a fluid container carried by the player. The liquid of the glass is absinthe. The current volume of the glass is 0.8 fl oz.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The pitcher is a fluid container in the Lakeside. The fluid capacity of the pitcher is 32.0 fl oz. The current volume of the pitcher is 20.0 fl oz. The liquid of the pitcher is absinthe.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The lake is a liquid source. It is in the Lakeside.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player wears a bathing outfit. The description of the bathing outfit is &quot;Stylishly striped in blue and white, and daringly cut to reveal almost all of your calves, and quite a bit of upper arm, as well. You had a moral struggle, purchasing it; but mercifully the lakeshore is sufficiently secluded that no one can see you in this immodest apparel.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking off the outfit: say &quot;What odd ideas come into your head sometimes!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;fill glass / empty absinthe into lake / fill glass / swim / drink lake / drink / x water / x lake&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
