<p>
<p>If we have some textual effect which needs to occur in several different messages, we might want to create a new text substitution for it. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Missile Base is a room. &quot;[security notice]Seems to be a futuristic missile base.&quot; M's Office is east of the Missile Base. &quot;[security notice]Admiral Sir M.- M.- glares up from his desk.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say security notice:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;This area is a Prohibited Place within the meaning of the Official Secrets Act 1939. &quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg in how to define ways to do things using &quot;To...&quot;, as we shall see. The definition makes &quot;say the security notice&quot; a new phrase known to Inform. A text substitution is exactly a phrase whose name begins with &quot;say&quot; (well - except for the &quot;say&quot; phrase itself), so the effect is that &quot;[security notice]&quot; is a new text substitution. Several of the examples in this chapter make use of this trick.
<p>
<p>Inform often ignores the casing of the text it reads, but sometimes uses it as a clue to meaning. We have already seen that &quot;[an item]&quot; and &quot;[An item]&quot; produce different results, for instance. Similarly, it's possible to define two text substitutions which are the same except for the initial casing. We might write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say Security Notice:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;THIS AREA IS A PROHIBITED PLACE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT 1939. &quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now Inform will act on &quot;[Security Notice]&quot; differently from &quot;[security notice]&quot;.
