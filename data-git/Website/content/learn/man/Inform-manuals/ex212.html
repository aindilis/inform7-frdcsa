Making new substitutions</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>If we have some textual effect which needs to occur in several different messages, we might want to create a new text substitution for it. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Missile Base is a room. &quot;[security notice]Seems to be a futuristic missile base.&quot; M's Office is east of the Missile Base. &quot;[security notice]Admiral Sir M.- M.- glares up from his desk.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say security notice:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;This area is a Prohibited Place within the meaning of the Official Secrets Act 1939. &quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg in how to define ways to do things using &quot;To...&quot;, as we shall see. The definition makes &quot;say the security notice&quot; a new phrase known to Inform. A text substitution is exactly a phrase whose name begins with &quot;say&quot; (well - except for the &quot;say&quot; phrase itself), so the effect is that &quot;[security notice]&quot; is a new text substitution. Several of the examples in this chapter make use of this trick.
<p>
<p>Inform often ignores the casing of the text it reads, but sometimes uses it as a clue to meaning. We have already seen that &quot;[an item]&quot; and &quot;[An item]&quot; produce different results, for instance. Similarly, it's possible to define two text substitutions which are the same except for the initial casing. We might write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say Security Notice:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;THIS AREA IS A PROHIBITED PLACE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT 1939. &quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now Inform will act on &quot;[Security Notice]&quot; differently from &quot;[security notice]&quot;.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>We can use these substitutions to put together fairly complicated variations within a single piece of text:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Fifty Ways to Leave Your Larva&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Beekeeper's Palace is a room. Wasp is a woman in the palace. Drone is a man in the palace.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of kissing someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'[denial], [insult]! [boast]!'&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In this context, [denial] is understood to refer to the denial property of the noun -- but we could spell it out with &quot;denial of the noun&quot; if we wanted to.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person has some text called denial. The denial of a person is usually &quot;Stand back&quot;. The denial of Drone is &quot;You forget yourself&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person has some text called  insult. The insult of a person is usually &quot;Grasshopper&quot;. The insult of Wasp is &quot;Larva&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person has some text called  boast. The boast of a person is usually &quot;I am ferocious&quot;. The boast of Drone is &quot;I have ferocious allies&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And then it would be trivial to insert further rules using these responses:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of attacking someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'Get away, [insult]!'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;kiss wasp / hit wasp / hit drone / kiss drone&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
