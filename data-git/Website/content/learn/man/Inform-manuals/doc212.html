<p>
<p>We can create new relations like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Loving relates various people to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Every relation has a name which ends with the word &quot;relation&quot;, and in this case the name is &quot;loving relation&quot;. While the name is often just two words long, as here, it doesn't have to be:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Adept sensitivity relates one person to one vehicle.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>makes the &quot;adept sensitivity relation&quot;. (The limit is 32 words.)
<p>
<p>In such a definition, we have to say what kind of thing appears on the left and right of any relation, and also whether &quot;one&quot; or &quot;various&quot; possibilities can exist. In the example
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Loving relates various people to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>what we are saying is that only people love; that they only love people; and that each person loves only one other person (at any given moment).
<p>
<p>The &quot;various&quot; part comes in because, for instance, we might have:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Verenka <i>loving relation</i> Stankevich
<br>Liubov <i>loving relation</i> Stankevich
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>so that various people (Verenka and Liubov, to name but two) love one person (Stankevich). But we are forbidding anyone to love two other people at the same time: Stankevich must decide which of them to love, or pick someone else, or no-one at all. Similarly, we would not allow
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Liubov <i>loving relation</i> Belinsky
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>It is sometimes convenient to give a name to the other side of a relationship, so to speak. We might imagine:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Pet-ownership relates various animals to one person (called the owner).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>It would then make sense to talk about &quot;the owner of Loulou&quot;, and we could have phrases like &quot;now Flaubert is the owner of Loulou&quot; or &quot;if the owner of Loulou is a woman...&quot; and so forth. This, however, would not be allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Pet-ownership relates various animals (called the pet) to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because &quot;the pet of Flaubert&quot; would be ambiguous: he might have owned dozens.
