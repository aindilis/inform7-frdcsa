<p>
<p>1. <b>An activity</b> is a process that can apply either to one thing or to nothing; every activity allows us to write &quot;before...&quot;, &quot;rule for...&quot;, and &quot;after...&quot; rules.
<p>
<p>In practice, new activities tend to be most useful when
<p>
<p>a. we are creating an extension or source that we expect other authors to use, and we want to provide an easy hook by which they can customize our output.
<p>
<p>b. we expect to write a lot of special cases to apply to a given situation, and we want the flexibility of rule definitions to describe these special cases.
<p>
<p>c. we want to define contexts within the game for use by other activities: for instance, we can write a rule such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of the spoon while asking which do you mean:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;enormous silver spoon&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>where the existence of the &quot;asking which do you mean&quot; activity makes it easy for us to tell Inform when to use this special name.
<p>
<p>2. <b>Creating new activities</b>:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Analysing something is an activity.
<br>Assaying is an activity.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Analysing something is an activity.
<br>The analysing activity has a text called first impression.
<br>Before analysing: now the first impression is &quot;unremarkable&quot;.
<br>Rule for analysing someone: now the first impression is &quot;living tissue&quot;.
<br>After analysing something (called the sample):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Your professional opinion of [the sample] is that it is [first impression].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining something (called the sample):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carry out the analysing activity with the sample.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can then invoke our created activities with phrases such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">carry out the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
<br>carry out the assaying activity;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>3. Because Inform's <b>predefined activities</b> are so numerous and specialized, we don't repeat all the examples here; it's worth looking back at individual sections to review what the specific activities can do.
<p>
<p>Printing and output
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Printing the name of something
