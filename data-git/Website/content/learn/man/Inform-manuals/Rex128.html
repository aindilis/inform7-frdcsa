<p>We may want to change the default refusal message when the player tries to pick up scenery: <b>Replanting</b> demonstrates this case simply.
<p>
<p><b>Removal</b> modifies responses to successful TAKE commands, with the effect that when the player picks up an item, he gets a response such as &quot;You take the book from the shelf.&quot;
<p>
<p><b>Croft</b> modifies the DROP command, so that objects dropped on specific surfaces get reported in a special way. <b>Celadon</b> allows the player to drop even objects he is carrying indirectly, for instance on a tray or in a sack.
<p>
<p><b>Morning After</b> introduces a simple rule that changes the behavior of the whole game: whenever the player takes an item he hasn't already looked at, he automatically examines it. This picks up the pace of exploration passages where the player is likely to be collecting a large number of objects.
<p>
<p>By default, when the player tries to put or insert an item that he isn't holding, Inform prints a refusal message; <b>Democratic Process</b> and <b>Sand</b> offer ways instead to have the player first pick up the relevant items. (The former applies to single items the player is trying to place; the latter expands coverage to work even if the player uses a command affecting multiple objects.)
<p>
<p>Taking also happens as a result of other commands. Such takes can be made unnecessary with a procedural rule to turn off the &quot;carrying requirements rule&quot; under particular circumstances, or presented differently using the implicitly taking activity.

<p>Suppose we want to make the player's life slightly easier by examining everything he picks up, if he hasn't already examined it.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Morning After&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be examined or unexamined.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After taking something unexamined:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Taken. [run paragraph on]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try examining the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out examining something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun is examined.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Carry out rules are explained in more detail in the chapter on advanced action handling. For now, it may be enough to know that what we put into this carry out rule for examining will happen any time anything is examined, but that it will not interfere with the rest of the predefined behavior of the action. The player will still see the object description and so on, as usual.
