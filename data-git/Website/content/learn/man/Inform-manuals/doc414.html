<p>
<p>Just as major movies and books are launched along with a publicity campaign which involves getting the press interested, so it can be with IF, on a more modest scale.
<p>
<p>Probably the best option here is to try to interest the editors of the long-standing webzine SPAG, which appears quarterly and is now well past its 50th issue:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">http://www.sparkynet.com/spag/
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If the editors bite, they may want to arrange for the new IF to be announced along with a review and write-up. This requires a little extra patience -- the release has to be timed to coincide with SPAG's publication date -- but that extra wait and effort can result in greater attention for the work. This is especially worthwhile for a major piece, one that's too large for competition entry and which has more to interest players than might first meet the eye.
<p>
<p>There are also lively webzines for the community of IF in languages other than English: for example, the excellent SPAC, which serves Spanish IF -
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">http://spac.caad.es/
</font></blockquote><p>
