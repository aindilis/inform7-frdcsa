Traveling Characters</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>There are a number of ways we can make characters navigate our map. We might reasonably want them to approach and follow the player (as in <b>Van Helsing</b>); or to allow the player to follow characters who have left the room (as in <b>Actaeon</b>).
<p>
<p>Characters who are less interested in the player will more likely follow their own courses around the available geography, however. A character may move randomly from room to room, as demonstrated in <b>Mistress of Animals</b>; he may follow a path that we have specifically written in advance, as <b>Odyssey</b> shows; or, most elegantly, he may use the &quot;best route&quot; calculation to find the best possible way to a given target room, as seen in <b>Latris Theon</b>.
<p>
<p>This final method is arguably the neatest solution to character movement, allowing for characters to act in sophisticated ways; if we incorporate the Locksmith extension, other characters will even unlock and open doors that are in their way. The chief catch is that it should not be used too profligately with large numbers of characters, since on slow machines the processing power required to plan all their travel will make a noticeable difference to the running speed of the game.
<p>
<p>All the same, the constraints are not so severe as to preclude having a moderate number of route-finding characters all wandering around at once. This does introduce a new problem, however: movement descriptions can become hard to follow if every turn produces long reams of reports such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Joe enters the room from the south.
<br>Lawrence opens the gate.
<br>Lawrence departs to the west.
<br>Lucy comes in from above.
<br>Ted enters the room from the south.
<br>Bill departs to the west.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p><b>Patient Zero</b> tackles this problem by calculating all of the character movement without printing any text; it then combines similar or related events into coherent paragraphs, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rhoda and Antony walk into the Post Office. Rhoda could have been rolling in chocolate and Antony looks as though dipped in french vanilla.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>or
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Antony opens the iron gate. He goes through.
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>
<p>Suppose we want the player to be able to go after characters who are moving around the map. The trick, of course, is that once characters are gone they are no longer visible to &quot;follow [person]&quot;, so we need &quot;follow [any person]&quot; to find them.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Actaeon&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person has a room called last location.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;follow [any person]&quot; as following. Understand the commands &quot;chase&quot; and &quot;pursue&quot; as &quot;follow&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Following is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check following:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is the player, say &quot;Wherever you go, there you are.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is visible, say &quot;[The noun] is right here.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the last location of the noun is not the location, say &quot;It's not clear where [the noun] has gone.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here again the best route comes in handy:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out following:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the destination be the location of the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the destination is not a room, say &quot;[The noun] isn't anywhere you can follow.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let aim be the best route from the location to the destination;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(heading [aim])[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try going aim.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Corinth is a room. Athens is east of Corinth. Epidaurus is southeast of Corinth and east of Mycenae. Mycenae is south of Corinth. Olympia is west of Mycenae. Argos is south of Mycenae. Thebes is northwest of Athens. Pylos is south of Olympia. Sparta is east of Pylos and south of Argos. Delphi is northwest of Thebes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Artemis is a woman in Corinth.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We do also have to make sure that whenever we move a person from room to room, we record where they were moved from; otherwise, our clever restrictions about whom the player can pursue will not work properly.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To move (pawn - a person) tidily to (target - a room):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the last location of the pawn is the holder of the pawn;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the pawn to the target.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let current location be the location of Artemis;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let next location be a random room which is adjacent to the current location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Artemis is visible, say &quot;Artemis heads to [the next location].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move Artemis tidily to next location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Artemis is visible, say &quot;Artemis arrives from [the current location].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;wait / follow artemis / follow artemis / follow artemis&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
