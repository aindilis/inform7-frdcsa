<p>Out of doors, nature is seldom still. Clouds scull by at random, as in <b>Weathering</b>, and provide some variety in what would otherwise be lifelessly static room descriptions. In much the same way, passers-by and other diversions make a city street a constant bustle: see <b>Uptown Girls</b> for this human breeze. A more nagging sense of atmosphere can be experienced in <b>Full Moon</b>.
<p>
<p><b>Orange Cones</b> offers traffic that is present on every road in the game unless a room is marked off with orange cones -- and this is allowed to change during play.
<p>
<p><b>Night and Day</b> and <b>Totality</b> each schedule celestial events to provide a changing display in the sky above, and this time running like clockwork rather than at random.

<a name="e260"><a href=Rdoc16.html#e260 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 164:  Night and Day</b></a><br>Cycling through a sequence of scenes to represent day and night following one another during a game.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we want to have a sequence of nights and days in our game, with one scene to govern each daylight condition.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Night and Day&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The sun is a backdrop. It is everywhere. The description is &quot;Currently out of sight.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Night is a recurring scene. Night begins when play begins. Night begins when Dusk ends. Night ends when the time since Night began is 3 minutes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Notice that our two conditions for the beginning of Night are not in conflict: it will be night-time when the game begins, and then night will also recur every time the Dusk scene ends.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Night begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The sun falls below the horizon and the temperature drops abruptly to well below zero.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the description of the sun is &quot;Currently out of sight.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Dawn is a recurring scene. Dawn begins when Night ends. Dawn ends when the time since Dawn began is 1 minute.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Dawn begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The sun appears on the horizon.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the description of the sun is &quot;It is tiny and weak.&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Day is a recurring scene. Day begins when Dawn ends. Day ends when the time since Day began is 3 minutes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Day begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The sun is now properly up.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Dusk is a recurring scene. Dusk begins when Day ends. Dusk ends when the time since Dusk began is 1 minute.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Dusk begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The sun has passed across the sky and is on the verge of setting.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Cratered Landscape is a room. &quot;The ground here is [if Night is happening]dim silver, with the craters visible as darker splotches[otherwise]the color of dried blood; here and there it is also rippled by impact craters[end if]. The horizon curves visibly.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;z / z / z / look / x sun / z / z / z / z / z / z / z&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we run this example and then have a look at the scenes index, we'll see that the cycle is listed through thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Night (recurring)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn (recurring)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day (recurring)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dusk (recurring)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>with the second &quot;Night&quot; in italics, to indicate that it is a repetition of the same scene that has already been listed above.
