<p>
<p>The following describes how Inform uses the extras file and the two HTML pages in a template, and will only be needed if a new template has to make changes so radical that altering the CSS alone won't be enough.
<p>
<p>The optional &quot;(extras).txt&quot; file - note brackets - is a text file which contains a list of named extras to throw in. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">easter.html
<br>egg.png
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These named files need to be present in the template folder. Files with the extension &quot;.html&quot; go through the placeholder expansion process just like the index and source pages; all other files are copied verbatim.
<p>
<p>HTML templates like &quot;index.html&quot; and &quot;source.html&quot; are fully valid HTML pages in their own right, though they have placeholder text where Inform will substitute the project's bibliographic data (see below). The &quot;&lt;head&gt;&quot; element should include a reference to &quot;style.css&quot;, which of course will mean the CSS file given in the template (or the one from &quot;Standard&quot; if no CSS file is given) - for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; media=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>When it turns the template into the final web page, what Inform does is to replace certain capitalised words in square brackets with the appropriate text:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">[TITLE] becomes the story title
<br>[AUTHOR] becomes the author's name
<br>[YEAR] becomes the story creation year
<br>[BLURB] becomes the story description
<br>[RELEASE] becomes the release number
<br>[COVER] becomes an image of the cover art (the small 120x120 cover image)
<br>[DOWNLOAD] becomes the download link
<br>[AUXILIARY] becomes the list of feelie-like files, if any
<br>[IFID] becomes the IFID
<br>[STORYFILE] becomes the &quot;leafname&quot; of the story file, e.g., &quot;Bronze.gblorb&quot;
<br>[TEMPLATE] becomes the name of the template used to make the page
<br>[SMALLCOVER] becomes the filename of the small cover image
<br>[BIGCOVER] becomes the filename of the large cover image
<br>[TIMESTAMP] and [DATESTAMP] become the time and date of releasing
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Everything else is left alone. In source pages, five further placeholders are available:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">[SOURCE] becomes the portion of the source text on this page
<br>[SOURCELINKS] becomes the navigational links
<br>[SOURCENOTES] becomes the footnote matter at the bottom of the source
<br>[PAGENUMBER] and [PAGEEXTENT] are such that the text &quot;page [PAGENUMBER] of [PAGEEXTENT]&quot; produces, e.g., &quot;page 2 of 7&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Both [SOURCE] and [SOURCENOTES] must exist on the page, and [SOURCENOTES] must appear after [SOURCE] does in the file. (Of course the CSS in &quot;style.css&quot; might move the copy around on screen, but that's another matter.)
