<p>The &quot;device&quot; kind provides for the simplest form of machine: one which is, at any given moment, switched on or switched off. Inform looks after this state, but leaves it to us to make the machine actually do something:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The air-conditioning unit is a device in the Florist's Shop. The air-conditioning is fixed in place and switched on.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when in the Florist's Shop:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the air-conditioning is switched off, say &quot;You worry about the cut flowers in this jungle-hot air.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;There is an low susurration from the air-conditioning unit.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>One primary dictionary definition for a machine is &quot;an apparatus using or applying mechanical power and having several parts&quot;, and we often use the &quot;part of&quot; relationship to build machinery. <b>Control Center</b> provides a neat way to display the component parts of a machine to the player who examines it.
<p>
<p>One component almost always part of an electrical machine is the (literal) switch, lever or button to control whether they are switched on or off. In <b>Model Shop</b> just such an on/off button is automatically made part of every device.
<p>
<p>While an electrical device has only two states, a mechanical machine might have many, and for these the best approach is to define a kind of value naming the possibilities: see <b>Signs and Portents</b>, where the states are the possible destinations pointed towards.
<p>
<p>Perhaps stretching the definition of &quot;machine&quot;, <b>What Makes You Tick</b> demonstrates a fishing pole which the player can put together from several pieces.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we want to let the player build a fishing pole out of three parts: a hook, a string, and a stick.
<p>
<p>There are several things we must account for here. One is that our combination verb should be insensitive to ordering: it shouldn't matter whether the player types COMBINE STICK WITH STRING or COMBINE STRING WITH STICK.
<p>
<p>Second, we need to make sure that our implementation handles intervening stages of assembly gracefully. The player should be able to combine string and hook first, or string and stick first, and be able to complete the assembly in either case.
<p>
<p>Our implementation here uses a table of lists to determine which combinations of inputs should produce which result object. Because we sort our lists before comparing them, we guarantee that the player's ordering doesn't matter: COMBINE STICK WITH STRING will have the same effect as COMBINE STRING WITH STICK.
<p>
<p>What's more, our implementation could be expanded to account for many other assemblages, if we wanted object-building to be a running theme of puzzles in our game.

<p>
<p>This kind of implementation makes sense if we don't intend the player to take the fishing pole apart again, or to refer to any of its component parts once it is built. For an alternate approach that does allow assembled objects to be taken apart again, see &quot;Some Assembly Required&quot;.
