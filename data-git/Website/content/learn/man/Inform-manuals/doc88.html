<p>
<p>We have seen two sorts of adjectives so far: those which refer to either/or properties, like &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot;, and those which come out of new kinds of value. If we define
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Texture is a kind of value. The textures are rough, stubbly and smooth. Everything has a texture.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...then &quot;rough&quot;, &quot;stubbly&quot; and &quot;smooth&quot; all become adjectives. (That last sentence &quot;Everything has a texture&quot; was essential, because without it Inform would not know that these words could meaningfully be applied to things.)
<p>
<p>In addition to these adjectives, we can create new ones (as we shall see), and a few special adjectives such as &quot;visible&quot;, &quot;touchable&quot; and &quot;adjacent&quot; are already defined for us by Inform.
