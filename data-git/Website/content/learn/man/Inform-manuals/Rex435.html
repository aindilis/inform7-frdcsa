<p>
<p>Some commands and some objects raise special challenges when it comes to working out the player's intention.
<p>
<p>Sometimes this can be done with good rules about the assumptions Inform should make. <b>Alpaca Farm</b> demonstrates a USE command, always a challenge because USE can mean very different actions with different items.
<p>
<p>There are also times when we need to ask the player for more information. <b>Apples</b> demonstrates how sensibly to use properties to disambiguate between similar objects, while <b>Walls and Noses</b> rephrases the disambiguation question when special objects are involved: examining one of the walls of the room will make the game ask &quot;In which direction?&quot; and EXAMINE NOSE will lead to &quot;Whose nose do you mean, Frederica's, Betty's, Wilma's or your own?&quot;
<p>
<p>At other times, the player types something that is wrong in a predictable way: for instance, we might want to remove all the &quot;with...&quot; phrases from commands like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">HIT DOOR WITH FIST
<br>KICK DRAGON WITH FOOT
<br>LOOK WEST WITH EYES
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and merely parse the remainder of the command. (That last command may be unlikely, but novice players do quite often type commands that refer unnecessarily to body parts.) <b>Cave-troll</b> demonstrates how.
<p>
<p><b>WXPQ</b> demonstrates how to modify the error message the parser gives in response to a command it doesn't understand; this particular example focuses on the &quot;That noun doesn't make sense in this context&quot; message that arises from using the &quot;[any thing]&quot; or &quot;[any room]&quot; tokens, but the techniques could be adapted to handling other parser errors as well.
<p>
<p>For catching typing errors, Cedric Knight's extension Mistype may also be of use: it provides an automatic typo-correction function that the player can turn on or off.

<a name="e435"><a href=Rdoc45.html#e435 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 366:  WXPQ</b></a><br>Creating a more sensible parser error than "that noun did not make sense in this context".<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>The parser error &quot;That noun did not make sense in this context&quot; arises instead of &quot;You can't see any such thing&quot; when the player uses a command that could apply to any item in the game -- that is, a command such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;go to [any room]&quot; as going directly to.
<br>Understand &quot;talk about [any subject]&quot; as discussing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...and so on. The idea here is that &quot;You can't see any such thing&quot; isn't a sensible rejoinder when the player doesn't really need to be able to see the object.
<p>
<p>Nonetheless, &quot;That noun did not make sense...&quot; is itself a fairly dry and uninformative response, and we may want to override it to something more appropriate for the specific kind of context in which it might appear. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;WXPQ&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">WXPQ Studio is a room. &quot;After about 2 AM, no one is listening anyway, so you can more or less make up whatever you like to fill the airwaves.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">John F Kennedy, Elvis, Ralph Nader, Tony Blair, and single-origin chocolate are things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;talk about [any thing]&quot; or &quot;discuss [any thing]&quot; as discussing. Discussing is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out discussing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You babble for a while about your [one of]interest in[or]hatred of[or]passionate devotion to[or]conspiracy theory concerning[or]mother's secret love affair with[as decreasingly likely outcomes] [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the noun did not make sense in that context error:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;For once, you're at a loss for anything to say.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;discuss Elvis / discuss Kennedy / discuss chocolate / discuss narratology vs ludology debate&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that this solution works as simply as it does because we only have one command in the game that can apply to an &quot;[any]&quot; token. If we had several, we'd need to distinguish between the parser error attached to &quot;discuss&quot; and the parser error attached to &quot;go to&quot; (for instance). In that case, we might instead write something like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the noun did not make sense in that context error:
<br>if the player's command includes &quot;go&quot;:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;There's no such place you know how to get to.&quot;;
<br>otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;For once, you're at a loss for anything to say.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
