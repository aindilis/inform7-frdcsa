Social Groups</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Crowds of characters introduce new challenges, because we often want to show them interacting with one another, or to describe individuals in less detail when a whole group is present.
<p>
<p><b>Strictly Ballroom</b> gives us a set of characters who pair off each turn, making sure to mention each one once, and leaving one unfortunate person behind as a wallflower: this exemplifies how we might use a behavioral rule not to dictate the behavior of each individual separately but rather to model a whole group together. <b>Happy Hour</b> does calculate movements for characters individually, but then collates the descriptions, creating a single paragraph to describe whatever group is currently in the room.
<p>
<p>Characters can also have complicated attitudes to one another, and it can be helpful to use relations to track these. <b>Unthinkable Alliances</b> demonstrates the grouping of characters into alliance factions, while <b>The Abolition of Love</b> provides a host of relations to track love affairs, marriages, memberships in families, and mere mutual respect.
<p>
<p><b>Emma</b> combines these two effects: its characters move between social groups depending on how they feel about the others in their particular talking circle, and descriptions change depending on who is where in the room.
<p>
<p><b>Lugubrious Pete's Delicatessen</b> simulates a queue at a deli, in which the customers who most impress Pete get served first.

<p>
<p>To start with, let's understand &quot;room&quot; to mean &quot;a group of people talking&quot;. These groups can grow and shrink as people come and go, so we'll want to name and rename them; and we're also going to need some rules to motivate people moving around, and a description to narrate how they behave when we're with them.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Emma&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">by the banquet table is a room. at the corner is a room. next to the doorway is a room. by the window is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Social clump is a kind of value. The social clumps are vacancy, lone person, couple, cluster, group.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A room has a social clump. Understand the social clump property as describing a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before printing the name of a room:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;a [social clump] &quot;.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After looking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assign clumping;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Elsewhere in the room, you can see [the list of rooms which are not the location].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;go to [any room]&quot; as joining. Joining is an action applying to one visible thing. Carry out joining: move player to the noun. Report joining: do nothing.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;examine [any room]&quot; as looking toward. Looking toward is an action applying to one visible thing. Carry out looking toward a room: say &quot;In that direction you see [a list of other people in the noun].&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: assign clumping. Every turn: assign clumping.

<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Liking relates various people to various people. The verb to like (he likes, they like, he liked, he is liked) implies the liking relation.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Weston, Mr Woodhouse, Mr Elton, Mr Knightley, and Frank Churchill are men. Mrs Weston, Mrs Bates, Miss Bates, Harriet Smith, Emma Woodhouse, and Jane Fairfax are women.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Knightley likes Emma Woodhouse, Mr Weston, and Mrs Weston. Mr Knightley desires Emma Woodhouse.

<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Frank Churchill desires Jane Fairfax and Emma Woodhouse. Frank Churchill likes Jane Fairfax.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Miss Bates likes Jane Fairfax, Emma Woodhouse, and Mrs Bates.

<p>

<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with character running through other people:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let space be a random room;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move character to space.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now we use writing a paragraph about... to describe character behavior in groups, when we join them:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Frank Churchill:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location contains a woman (called flirt) who is desired by Frank:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[Frank Churchill] is talking with great animation and slightly more than becoming warmth to [the flirt][if an unmentioned other person is in the location], while [the list of unmentioned other people in the location] look on with varying degrees of amusement or irritation[end if].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with character running through people in the location:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the character is not Churchill and the character is not the flirt, now the character is bored.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Mr Elton:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location contains an unmentioned woman (called flirt) who is desired by Elton:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[Mr Elton] hangs on the sleeve of [the flirt], offering an assortment of studied gallantries that make you wonder about his good sense.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with character running through people in the location:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the character is not Elton and the character is not the flirt, now the character is bored.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Harriet Smith:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location contains Emma and Emma is unmentioned:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[Harriet] and [Emma] are conversing in low tones -- Harriet, apparently, being too shy to speak so that everyone can hear her.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Mr Knightley:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location contains an unmentioned man (called the listener) who is not Mr Knightley:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[Mr Knightley] is speaking with [the listener] about agricultural matters.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the listener is complacent.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Miss Bates:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[Miss Bates] is giggling about the weather[if an unmentioned other person is in the location]. This does not seem to compel the interest of [the list of unmentioned other people in the location][end if].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with character running through people in the location:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the character is not Miss Bates and character is not Mrs Bates, now the character is bored.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Since this is just an example, we'll stop here, but there's no reason we couldn't write such paragraphs for everyone.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;z / z / z / look / x corner / x doorway / x window / x table / go to the table&quot;.
