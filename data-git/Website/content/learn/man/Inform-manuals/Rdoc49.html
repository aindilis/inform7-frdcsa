<p>As we observe characters, so they observe us. Those who seem to have no awareness of what the player is doing often come across more like waxworks than like people. <b>Zodiac</b> demonstrates a scenario where the watchful presence of a dangerous criminal keeps the player from doing what he otherwise might, while <b>Police State</b> expands on this idea with a policeman who reacts to entire types of behavior in his presence, regardless of whether the culprit is the player or a third party. <b>Noisemaking</b> has a crow who will fly away in response to any loud noises the player makes.
<p>
<p>And, of course, we definitely want to have characters react to being looked at or otherwise interfered with. <b>Search and Seizure</b> implements a smuggler who reacts when we try to confiscate his possessions. <b>Pine 1</b> gives us a sleeping princess who can be woken by a variety of methods.
<p>
<p>We wrap up this section with two complete puzzle scenarios that demonstrate what can be achieved by giving characters reactions to the player's behavior. <b>A Day For Fresh Sushi</b> has a fish who watches the player's actions and comments on them, while the live furnishings in <b>Revenge of the Fussy Table</b> instead comment every turn on the current state of the world, until the player has successfully sorted out all their complaints.
