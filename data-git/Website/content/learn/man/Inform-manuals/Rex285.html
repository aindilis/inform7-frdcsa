Character Emotion</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>In a complex story, characters may evolve strong feelings about the player. Often we want to hint at the character's feelings through gesture and tone of voice - little things woven into dialogue and action sequences that might otherwise be unchanged. <b>Ferragamo Again</b> demonstrates creating phrases to give all our characters different ways to express their irritation at the player.
<p>
<p>Then again, sometimes a discussion might produce quite spectacular results if a character is in the wrong mood. <b>Being Peter</b> shows the bare bones of an implementation in which a character's attitude rulebook is consulted to determine what her response will be - allowing for arbitrarily complicated outcomes.

<p>
<p>Let's say that we're implementing a particularly irrational and volatile character. Some of the time she remains composed; some of the time she reacts with unexpected vehemence for reasons only partly related to what was said.
<p>
<p>Moreover, her responses are divided between successful and failing outcomes, where success indicates that she's not too upset and failure means that she is distraught; we use this to determine how the rest of the room reacts.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Being Peter&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Drawing Room is a room. &quot;The company is assembled here for champagne. Most of it, anyway: Mary is on the phone to her babysitter, Roger is keeping her anxious company, and Carol doesn't drink. But everyone else.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Maggie is a woman in the Drawing Room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player wears a top hat.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Quizzing it about is an action applying to one thing and one visible thing. Understand &quot;ask [someone] about [any thing]&quot; as quizzing it about.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of quizzing Maggie about something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider the attitude rules;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Everyone waits to see what the reaction will be: [outcome of the rulebook].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if rule succeeded, say &quot;There is general relief.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;Everyone is pointedly silent.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The attitude rules are a rulebook. The attitude rules have outcomes she stays calm (no outcome - default), she gets angry (failure), she has a stroke (failure), she is only mildly annoyed (success), and she is elated (success).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here we want Inform to consult every appropriate attitude rule until it gets to some answer; if an attitude rule does not provide a result, the default 'no outcome' will mean that we go on to the next rule, and so on.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A subject is a kind of thing. income, love life, and children are subjects.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An attitude rule for quizzing Maggie about love life:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she gets angry.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An attitude rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player wears the top hat, she gets angry.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now, as we saw, the 'no outcome' result will never be returned and printed as Maggie's reaction, precisely because it is &quot;no outcome&quot;. Therefore, we provide a final attitude rule which will give her a default response to all statements:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The last attitude rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she is only mildly annoyed.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;ask maggie about love / ask maggie about income / take off hat / ask maggie about income&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There are plenty of contexts where we might want named outcomes for clarity but not want to print the results literally afterward.
