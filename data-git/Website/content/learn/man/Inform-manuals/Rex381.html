The Passage Of Time</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>A game that makes heavy use of time may want to give the player a hint that time is important - and an easy way to keep track of how it's going - by adding the current time to the status line, instead of the score. To do this, we would write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: change the right hand status line to &quot;[time of day]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>All else being equal, time passes at a rate of one minute per turn. But this need not be so: we can imagine a game where turns take much less time, or much more; or a game in which the passage of time was sometimes suspended, or one in which different actions required different amounts of time to perform.
<p>
<p><b>Situation Room</b> provides a way to print 24-hour time, while <b>Zqlran Era 8</b> implements a completely new measurement of time, for a game set on an alien world.
<p>
<p><b>Uptempo</b> and <b>The Hang of Thursdays</b> speed up time's passage: turns take fifteen minutes in the former, or a quarter day in the latter.
<p>
<p><b>Timeless</b> makes certain actions instant, so that they don't count against the clock; this is sometimes useful in timed situations where the player needs to review the situation before going on with a tricky puzzle. <b>Endurance</b> systematically extends this idea to allow us to assign different durations to any action in the game. <b>The Big Sainsbury's</b> goes the opposite direction, and meticulously adds a minute to the clock for all implicit take actions, just so that the player isn't allowed to economize on moves.
<p>
<p>An alternative approach to time is not to tell the player specifically what hour of the day it is at all, but to move from one general time period to another as it becomes appropriate - when the player has solved enough puzzles, or worked his way through enough of the plot. To this end we might use scenes representing, say, Thursday afternoon and then Thursday evening; then our scene rules, rather than the clock, would determine when Thursday afternoon stopped and Thursday evening began:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Thursday afternoon is a scene. Thursday evening is a scene.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Thursday afternoon ends when the player carries the portfolio.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Thursday evening begins when Thursday afternoon ends.
<br>When Thursday evening begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The great clock over St. Margaret's begins to chime 6.&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Though this gives time a loose relation to the number of turns played, it feels surprisingly realistic: players tend to think of time in a game in terms of the number of <i>significant</i> moves they made, while the random wandering, taking inventory, and looking at room descriptions while stuck don't make as big an impression. So advancing the game clock alongside the player's puzzle solutions or plot progress can work just as well as any stricter calculation.

<p>
<p>In a game with tight timing, it is sometimes friendliest to the player to let him LOOK and EXAMINE as much as necessary without being penalized.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Timeless&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Examining something is acting fast. Looking is acting fast.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we need a rule which, just at the right moment, stops the turn sequence rulebook in the cast of our new fast-acting actions:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The take visual actions out of world rule is listed before the every turn stage rule in the turn sequence rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the take visual actions out of world rule: if acting fast, rule succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Thus the rest of the turn sequence rulebook is omitted for looking or examining: in effect, they become out-of-world actions like &quot;saving the game&quot;. If we wanted to add, say, taking inventory to the list of instant activities, we would just need to define it as acting fast, too.
<p>
<p>Now the scenario for testing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You are cornered by a pack of zombie wolves, armed only with a torch and a pair of pinking shears. This may be your last moment on earth, unless you can think fast!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Cleft is a room. &quot;You're backed into a cleft in the granite: behind you are only steep, high faces of stone, and before you a narrow passage.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The plural of zombie wolf is zombie wolves. A zombie wolf is a kind of animal. Four zombie wolves are in Cleft.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about zombie wolves:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The good news is that there isn't much space in which for the zombie wolves to attack.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every zombie wolf is mentioned.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A steep high face of stone is scenery in Cleft. Understand &quot;rock&quot; as the stone. The description is &quot;Now that you look more closely, there appear to be pitons driven into the rock.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Some pitons are part of the stone. The description of the pitons is &quot;It looks as though someone else has made this ascent before.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of climbing the stone, try going up. Instead of climbing the pitons, try going up.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Above the Cleft is Clifftop.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when the location is Cleft:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Alas, your time has run out. The alpha wolf springs--&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the story.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when the location is Clifftop:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;After a breathless climb, you emerge at last onto the open clifftop.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the story finally.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x me / x stone / x pitons / climb pitons&quot;.
