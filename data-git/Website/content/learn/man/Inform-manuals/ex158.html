<p>Once we begin applying rules to actions which are not entirely known in advance, we have a problem: there's no way to find out what specifically is happening. Consider the following:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining something, say &quot;It is none of your concern!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is fine as far as it goes, but clumsy. What if the player had examined a human being? Then &quot;it&quot; would be inappropriate. A better approach would be this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining something, say &quot;[The noun] is none of your concern!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;noun&quot; and, when necessary, the &quot;second noun&quot; are values which can be used in any rule about actions, and it follows that they can also be substituted into text, as this example demonstrates. Results might include:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Lady Bracknell is none of your concern!
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The silver cigarette case is none of your concern!
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This seems a good moment to mention that if you use &quot;The&quot; in a substitution, then a capitalised &quot;The&quot; will be used so long as this is grammatically correct (Lady Bracknell, as a proper noun, takes no article); &quot;the&quot; becomes a lower-case &quot;the&quot; along the same lines; and &quot;a&quot; a lower-case indefinite article.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining something in the Drawing Room, say &quot;Under Lady Bracknell's eye, you feel constrained. Besides, it is only [a noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<a name="e158"><a href=doc112.html#e158 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 97:  Ming Vase</b></a><br>ATTACK or DROP break and remove fragile items from play.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>In emulation of a certain annoying aspect of the original Adventure, in which there is a Ming vase that cannot safely be dropped:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Ming Vase&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be strong or fragile. A thing is usually strong.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of attacking or dropping a fragile thing: remove the noun from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] breaks into thousands of pieces!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Cave is a room. The Ming vase is carried by the player. The vase is fragile.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We could also implement an additional refinement from Adventure, that a fragile thing is safe if dropped when there is a cushion nearby.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The pillow is a portable supporter. It is carried by the player.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of dropping a fragile thing when the pillow is in the location: try putting the noun on the pillow instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After putting a fragile thing on the pillow:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You set [the noun] down gently on the pillow.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;drop pillow / drop vase / get vase / get pillow / drop vase&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In this rule, the pillow is the second noun; if we had a general rule about setting fragile things on soft things, we could say &quot;You set [the noun] down gently on [the second noun].&quot; for the same effect.
<p>
<p>If we wanted to be more refined, we would provide extra code so that breaking a container or a supporter would leave behind their contents. We will see how to do that later.
