<p>The properties we have seen so far have all been either/or: either open or closed, either transparent or opaque, either fixed in place or portable, either openable or not openable. However, some properties can have a much wider range of possibilities. For instance, the &quot;description&quot; of a room is the text revealed when the player first enters it, or types &quot;look&quot;. This needs to be textual: Inform would complain if, for instance, we tried to set the description of something to the number 42. We have already seen a concise way to set the description of a room:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Painted Room is north of the Undertomb. &quot;This is the Painted Room, where strange wall drawings leap out of the dark at the gleam of your candle: men with long wings and great eyes, serene and morose.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This does the same thing as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Painted Room is north of the Undertomb. The description of the Painted Room is &quot;This is the Painted Room, where strange wall drawings leap out of the dark at the gleam of your candle: men with long wings and great eyes, serene and morose.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Or even:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Painted Room is north of the Undertomb. The description is &quot;This is the Painted Room, where strange wall drawings leap out of the dark at the gleam of your candle: men with long wings and great eyes, serene and morose.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
