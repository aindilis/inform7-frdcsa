<p>
<p>A point which has come up several times in recent chapters is that enumerated kinds of value have a natural ordering. For example, if we write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...then we not only have seven possible values, we have put them into a sequence, in order of their naming. We can't perform arithmetic on colours, of course, but we can perform comparisons on them. Thus &quot;red &lt; yellow&quot; is true, while &quot;green &gt;= violet&quot; is not. (More on comparisons in the chapter on units, which also covers arithmetic.)
<p>
<p>It's also sometimes useful to get at the sequence directly. First, the two ends:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>first value of </b>(name of kind)<b></b> ... <i>value</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_enumfirst -->

<p>This phrase produces the first-created value of the given kind, which should be an enumeration. Example: if we have
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then &quot;first value of colour&quot; is red.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>last value of </b>(name of kind)<b></b> ... <i>value</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_enumlast -->

<p>This phrase produces the last-created value of the given kind, which should be an enumeration. Example: if we have
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then &quot;last value of colour&quot; is violet.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>And now how to step forward and back:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b></b>(name of kind)<b> after </b>(enumerated value)<b></b> ... <i>value</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_enumafter -->

<p>This phrase produces the next-created value of the given kind, which should be an enumeration. Example: if we have
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then &quot;colour after orange&quot; is yellow.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b></b>(name of kind)<b> before </b>(enumerated value)<b></b> ... <i>value</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_enumbefore -->

<p>This phrase produces the previous-created value of the given kind, which should be an enumeration. Example: if we have
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then &quot;colour before blue&quot; is green.
