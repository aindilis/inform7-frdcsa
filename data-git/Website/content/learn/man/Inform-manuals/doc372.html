<p>
<p>Back in Chapter 2, we saw that the Settings panel allows any given Inform project to be produced in one of four possible story file formats. Recall that story files are the released IF works: what the player sees. The source text, the Skein, and so on are not part of this. Although those four possible formats were introduced in Chapter 2, they have not been mentioned since, because almost everything in Inform will work fine on any of the possibilities.
<p>
<p>However, once we go beyond text and into images, they begin to behave differently.
<p>
<p>A story file is not like a word-processed document, or a photograph. There are many rival formats for these - for instance, an image on a web page might be in JPEG or PNG format, among many others - but basically they are simple things for the reader to look at, and see everything in one go. An IF story file is more complicated, because the &quot;reader&quot; reacts to it, types in to it, is surprised by it, never quite knows what might happen next.
<p>
<p>A story file is in fact a computer program in its own right, but not a program like iTunes or Firefox which runs on a typical home or business computer. Instead it is a program for an imaginary computer, called a &quot;virtual machine&quot; or &quot;VM&quot;. This has a design ideally suited to IF, and it would be the perfect IF player's computer if only it actually existed. Because it doesn't, the player instead runs an &quot;interpreter&quot; program like Windows Glulxe or Zoom or Spatterlight - and this one is a program like iTunes or Firefox - and the interpreter acts as a middle-man. It creates a software version of the virtual machine, and then runs the IF story file on that VM. This sounds slow and impractical, but in fact it works well, and is also much safer since programs on the VM are not allowed to touch the real computer - so they cannot at all easily contain viruses or other malware. (In theory a malicious story file might try to exploit a bug in one of the various VM implementations in use, just as malicious image files have been used to attack bugs in web browsers, but this has never in practice happened. Nothing can be absolutely safe, but a story file belongs in the &quot;mostly harmless&quot; category of files - like images - rather than the &quot;how far do you trust this person?&quot; category - like programs.)
<p>
<p>The different formats of story file are programs for different virtual machines. Just as Windows and Mac OS X offer basically similar services to the user but are very different in appearance and their workings, so the different VMs are quite different. Some can display pictures, others not.
