<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> When an item is listed in the miscellaneous collection of items present in a room (the ones which do not deserve their own paragraphs): this is normally the last paragraph of a room description.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> A bracketed piece of extra information is added for certain items such as containers:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You can also see Po and a cage (empty) here.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot; (empty)&quot; (note initial space) was added by this activity. (Note that this activity is not responsible for describing further items visible because of the item in question: that is, it does not print the text such as &quot;(in which is a notepad)&quot; which would appear if there were contents. If we want to remove such text, we should use &quot;omit contents in listing&quot;: see the activity &quot;for printing the name of something&quot;.)
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) To get rid of such addenda entirely, try:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing room description details: stop.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(b) To add a new form of addendum:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing room description details of a person:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot; (at last, someone to talk to)&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If both examples (a) and (b) are in place at once, we might now read:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You can also see Po (at last, someone to talk to) and a cage here.
</font></blockquote><p>

<a name="e233"><a href=doc296.html#e233 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 332:  Rules of Attraction</b></a><br>A magnet which picks up nearby metal objects, and describes itself appropriately in room descriptions and inventory listings, but otherwise goes by its ordinary name.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Often we have some salient features of an object that we want to make sure the player notices whenever looking at the item in a room or in inventory. At other times, we may prefer to allow the name of the item to be printed bare. So for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Rules of Attraction&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A metal form is a kind of thing. A magnet is a kind of metal form.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through nonmagnetic metal forms which are not part of something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if item is in a container which contains a magnet (called attractor):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The item] sticks to [the attractor].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the item is part of the attractor.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The horseshoe magnet is a magnet carried by the player. The nail is a metal form carried by the player. The Barn is a room. In the Barn is a bucket. In the bucket is a metal form called the iron hook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is nonmagnetic if it is not a magnet.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing room description details of a magnet (called attractor): if something is part of the attractor, say &quot; (stuck to which [is-are the list of things which are part of the attractor])&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the name of a magnet (called attractor) while taking inventory:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if something is part of the attractor, say &quot; (stuck to which [is-are the list of things which are part of the attractor])&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before taking a touchable thing which is part of a magnet (called attractor):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the noun to the holder of the attractor.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;i / put horseshoe in bucket / look / get horseshoe / i / drop horseshoe / i / look / get all / put all in bucket / i / x magnet / get nail / i&quot;.
