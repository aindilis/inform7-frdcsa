<p>
<p>A character who sits still in a chair and does nothing is much less convincingly alive than one who seems to be pursuing some sort of personal agenda. There are all sorts of ways to achieve this, but the least challenging is by introducing some random change to descriptions, and by giving a character some very simple routine behavior to carry out.
<p>
<p>For instance, we'll often want the characters in a room to be described doing different things every time we look at them. <b>Camp Bethel</b> shows how this may be done.
<p>
<p>Every turn rules lend some sprightliness to otherwise-silent characters, as well:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when the player can see Mrs MacGillicuddy:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Mrs. MacGillicuddy vacuums around [a random fixed in place thing which is in the location].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We might expand on this by providing a whole table of things for Mrs MacG. to cycle through, or a text variation effect that gives her different activities every turn, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when the player can see Mrs MacGillicuddy:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Mrs. MacGillicuddy [one of]vacuums around the furniture[or]tries to remove gum from the underside of the desks[or]causes a racket by testing the smoke alarm[or]makes a pointed comment or two about them as sit by idly while someone works her fingers to the bone[as decreasingly likely outcomes].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is no great innovation in characterization by itself, but it does at least remind the player that the character is alive and moving about, even when he isn't paying attention to her.
<p>
<p><b>Annoyotron Jr</b> demonstrates a character who actively tries to get our attention, and whose routine of behavior changes just slightly if we show signs of having reacted to him.
<p>
<p><b>Lean and Hungry</b> implements a classic thief, a character who doesn't interact with the player much except to pick up valuable objects he finds left around the map. Later we will see rather more advanced ways to make characters act on their own goals and plans, but this kind of simple behavior is easily rigged as part of an every turn rule.
<p>
<p>Finally, <b>Text Foosball</b> extends the every-turn-rule idea to create an opponent who joins us in a randomized game of table soccer.
<p>
<p>With animal characters, this kind of repetitive, semi-random behavior is often adequate: we don't expect animals to talk, or pursue steady goals, or to take an interest in what we do in their presence (unless it involves a food they like to eat).
<p>
<p>For people, we are likely to need an assortment of additional techniques.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we want a game of foosball in which our opponent acts every turn, but does different things depending on where the ball currently lies. We can put together a sequence of every-turn rules to account for this, as follows:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Text Foosball&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Lounge is a room. &quot;The Lounge is appointed with everything necessary to rest and relaxation: a vending machine, a potted palm, a stack of Entertainment Weekly issues from 1993, and -- your pride and joy -- a foosball game.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The foosball game is scenery in the Lounge. Understand &quot;table&quot; or &quot;football&quot; or &quot;foozball&quot; or &quot;fussball&quot; or &quot;soccer&quot; as the foosball game. The game is a supporter. On the game is a small white ball. The ball can be still, approaching, receding, or unreachable. The description of the ball is &quot;Currently [small white ball condition].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the name of the small white ball, say &quot; ([small white ball condition])&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now left hand status line is &quot;You: [score]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now right hand status line is &quot;Joey: [Joey's score]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Some tiny men on sticks are part of the game. Understand &quot;handles&quot; as the tiny men. The description is &quot;Okay, a couple of the tiny men have had their feet broken off, and the table surface itself is a bit warped, and the ball resembles a quail egg in respect of shape and color. This makes for a game of unusual randomness, but skill is overrated.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of attacking or pulling or pushing the game when the ball is unreachable:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You give the table a good shove, and the ball moves ever-so-slightly.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the ball is still.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking the white ball:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You'd forfeit the game if you did that.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of turning the tiny men when the ball is unreachable:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The ball has somehow gotten to a mystical point on the table where it cannot be reached, no matter what. Close inspection reveals that this point has been marked in chalk with a tiny X. Not that that does any good.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of turning the tiny men when the ball is approaching:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a random chance of 2 in 3 succeeds:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds, now the ball is receding;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise now the ball is still;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[if the ball is still]Thunk. [otherwise]Thwack! [end if]You keep the ball from reaching its goal! Now it is [small white ball condition].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Joey score.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To let Joey score:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the ball is still;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now Joey's score is Joey's score + 1;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The ball rolls neatly into your goal, despite your efforts. &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Joey's score < score, say &quot;You put the ball back in the center with a snap. No reason to worry yet; you're still ahead. Joey looks determined, though.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;After allowing a moment or two for Joey's gloating to pass, you replace it at the center.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of turning the tiny men when a random chance of 1 in 13 succeeds:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the ball is unreachable, continue the action;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the ball is unreachable;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You hit the ball off-center and it rolls sluggishly into a little dip in the surface of the foosball table. &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Joey's score > 7, say &quot;'You did that on purpose!' Joey exclaims indignantly.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;You and Joey exchange glances. This is never good.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of turning the tiny men:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You madly rotate the tiny men on sticks! &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Hoorah! You hit the ball!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the ball is receding;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Somehow you fail to bring your monopodal player into contact with the ball.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Joey is a man in the Lounge. &quot;Joey is hunkered over the foosball handles on his side of the table.&quot; Joey can be active or inactive.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Joey's score is a number that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn: now Joey is active.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when the ball is approaching and Joey is active:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let total be Joey's score + score;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if total > 9, make no decision;
