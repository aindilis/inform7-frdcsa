<p>
<p>A sentence consists of two nouns with a verb between them. Usually, the two nouns are descriptions, as in:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Collins is in a lighted room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here &quot;Mr Collins&quot; and &quot;a lighted room&quot; are descriptions, the full rules for which were given in Chapter 5. But there are sentences where one or both of the nouns is a value instead. For instance, in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the score is greater than 10, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>the sentence &quot;the score is greater than 10&quot; consists of two values (&quot;the score&quot; and &quot;10&quot;) connected by a verb part (&quot;is greater than&quot;).
<p>
<p>This chapter is about getting the most out of sentences by defining new verbs to express ideas not already built in to Inform. Before we can define a new sentence verb, however, we must first look at the meanings of verbs: which Inform calls &quot;relations&quot;.
