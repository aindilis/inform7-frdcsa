<p>
<p>The &quot;photographing&quot; action now works very nicely when the player does it. But not when others try. Suppose that neither the player, nor Clark Gable, is holding the camera:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>photograph clark
<br>You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>clark, photograph me
<br>>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>An uncanny silence. What has happened is that the rules written so far are all implicitly restricted to the player only. This is because when we write -
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check photographing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the camera is not carried:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>the action is &quot;photographing&quot;, not &quot;Clark photographing&quot;. In the next few sections we shall see how to make the rules work nicely for everybody. This is a little bit harder, so it should be noted right away that in many projects there is no need. In a game which has no other characters who succumb to persuasion, for instance, only the player will ever try the action.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There are quite a few actions for which no automatic other-character behavior is provided at all, because they always end in failure when the player tries them. Currently the response is not very interesting. Let's spice it up a bit:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Burning something is useless action. Waking up is useless action. Thinking is useless action. Cutting is useless action. Jumping is useless action. Tying something to something is useless action. Drinking something is useless action. Swinging is useless action.  Rubbing is useless action. Setting something to something is useless action. Waving hands is useless action. Buying is useless action. Singing is useless action. Climbing is useless action. Sleeping is useless action. Kissing is useless action. Throwing something at something is useless action. Attacking is useless action. Asking something about something is useless action. Telling something about something is useless action. Answering something that something is useless action. Waking something is useless action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A persuasion rule for asking people to try useless action:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Clark Gable frowns. 'I don't mean to be difficult, but I can't see any point in that.'&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persuasion fails.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A persuasion rule for asking Clark to try taking off the pants:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;He gives you a look of mocking exasperation. Apparently you'll have to take a (slightly) more subtle approach.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persuasion fails.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check someone giving something to someone (this is the can't give worn items rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the person asked wears the noun, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And because we do not want Clark automatically taking off the pants as the result of a drop action:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of Clark taking off the pants: do nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We know that this can only come about as a default action, because we have arranged matters so that he cannot be persuaded directly.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;give dress to clark / clark, take off pants / clark, sing / clark, eat pants / clark, give me the pants / clark, drop pants / clark, put the pants in the briefcase / again / g / g / g&quot;
