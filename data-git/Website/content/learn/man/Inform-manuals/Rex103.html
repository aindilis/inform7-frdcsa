<p>
<p>Inform provides an either/or property called &quot;edible&quot; and action, &quot;eating&quot;, for consuming edible things:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The lardy cake is edible. After eating the lardy cake, say &quot;Sticky but delicious.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>One of Inform's rules is that a person can only eat what he or she is holding - normally realistic, but it does prevent, say, eating a cherry off the tree. A procedural rule can override this: see <b>Lollipop Guild</b>. <b>Delicious, Delicious Rocks</b>, on the other hand, adds a sanity check which prevents the player from automatically taking inedible things only to be told they can't be eaten.
<p>
<p>Inform does not normally simulate taste or digestion, but to provide foods with a range of flavours, see <b>Would you...?</b>; to make eating different foods affect the player differently, see <b>Stone</b>, or for the extreme case of poisoning foods, <b>Candy</b>. In <b>MRE</b>, hunger causes the player problems unless he regularly finds and eats food.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e103"><a href=Rdoc68.html#e103 STYLE="text-decoration: none">***<b><b>Example</b> 196:  Delicious, Delicious Rocks</b></a><br>Adding a "sanity-check" stage to decide whether an action makes any sense, which occurs before any before rules, implicit taking, or check rules.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>In some cases, we may want to add new stages to action processing. One possibility is a stage where we check the sanity of what the player is trying to do before executing any of the other commands; so that we avoid, for instance
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>EAT ROCK
<br>(first taking the rock)
<br>That's plainly inedible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here is how we might insert such a stage in our action processing, using rulebook manipulation.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;Delicious, Delicious Rocks&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 1 - Procedure
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The sanity-check rules are a rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the sanity-check stage rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abide by the sanity-check rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The sanity-check stage rule is listed after the before stage rule  in the action-processing rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 2 - Scenario
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Candyland is a room. The lollipop tree is an edible thing in Candyland. The genuine rock is a thing in Candyland.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Sanity-check eating an inedible thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Your digestion is so delicate -- you're sure [the noun] wouldn't agree with you.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;eat lollipop / eat rock&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Notice that now Inform does not try taking the rock before rejecting the player's attempt to eat it.
<p>
<p>It is of course possible to get the same effect with
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before eating an inedible thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Your digestion is so delicate -- you're sure [the noun] wouldn't agree with you.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...and in a small game with few rules, there's not much reason to add an extra stage. The ability to modify the stages of action processing becomes useful when we have a fairly large game with sophisticated modeling and want to be sure that some kinds of message (such as the sanity-check) are always handled before other things that we might be doing at the before stage (such as generating implicit actions like opening doors before going through them).
