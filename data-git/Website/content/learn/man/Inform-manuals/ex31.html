<p>
<p>Some things will occasionally be in a limbo state called being &quot;off-stage&quot;: like actors or props not needed in Act II, but perhaps to be brought back on-stage later, they wait on the sidelines. Anything created with no apparent location will start the game off-stage, as in the case of the lamp here:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Aladdin's Cave is a room. The genie's lamp is a container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Such things are easy to see in the World index because they are listed after all of the rooms and their contents, not belonging inside any room.)
<p>
<p>To move something back on-stage, we simply &quot;move&quot; it back onto the stage set, so to speak: back to a room, or into, onto, or made part of something else which is currently on-stage. To remove something, we use the phrase:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>remove </b>(object)<b> from play</b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_remove -->

<p>Removes the given object from play, so that it is not present in any room. We are not permitted to remove rooms, or doors, or the player, from play; but we are permitted to remove backdrops, making them disappear from all rooms in which they are present. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">remove the gold coin from play;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p> We can test whether something is on-stage or off-stage with:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the gold coin is on-stage, ...
<br>if the gold coin is off-stage, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>or could, for instance, write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;Ah, so many absent friends. Who now remembers [list of off-stage people]?&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can even write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now the gold coin is off-stage
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which is equivalent the &quot;remove the gold coin from play&quot;, and similarly for on-stage. (If we say &quot;now the gold coin is on-stage&quot; and it already was, nothing happens; if it wasn't, it is moved to the current location.)
<p>
<p>&quot;On-stage&quot; and &quot;off-stage&quot; are adjectives, like &quot;visible&quot; or &quot;touchable&quot;, and they apply only to things. Rooms, directions and regions are the stage itself: so it makes no sense to ask the question of whether they are &quot;on-&quot; or &quot;off-&quot;. Doors are always on-stage; backdrops are on-stage unless they have been explicitly removed using the &quot;remove... from play&quot; phrase.

<p>
<p>Some kinds of game objects -- food, for instance -- can only sensibly be used once, and should then be destroyed. The EAT command already implements this, but suppose we also had a category of drinkable potions:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Beverage Service&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A potion is a kind of thing. The sparkly blue potion is a potion carried by the player.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Level 3 is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of drinking a potion:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the noun from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You quaff [the noun]. It goes down beautifully.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;drink sparkly / i&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
