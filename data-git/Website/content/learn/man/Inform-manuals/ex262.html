<p>
<p>The five senses are all simulated with actions. Sight is so informative that it is handled by a whole range of actions: &quot;looking&quot;, which describes the general scene; &quot;examining something&quot;, which takes a closer look at a specific thing; &quot;looking under something&quot;, and so on.
<p>
<p>The other senses have one action each: &quot;listening to something&quot;, &quot;touching something&quot;, &quot;tasting something&quot; and &quot;smelling something&quot;. It makes no sense to touch or taste the general scene, but listening and smelling are a different matter: we often just listen, without listening to anything specific. If the player types the command &quot;listen&quot;, Inform understands that as listening to the current location: similarly for the bare command &quot;smell&quot;. Thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of listening to the Seashore, say &quot;The song of gulls.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of smelling the Cave, say &quot;Salt and old seaweed.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Note the difference between this and saying:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of listening <b>in</b> the Seashore, say &quot;The song of gulls.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>With this rule, even typing &quot;listen to shell&quot; when at the Seashore would result in the song of gulls: fine if the gulls drown all else out, but otherwise incongruous.)

<p>This example involves redesigning the LISTEN command, removing its built-in function and replacing that with something more ambitious. We will learn more about how to do this later on.
