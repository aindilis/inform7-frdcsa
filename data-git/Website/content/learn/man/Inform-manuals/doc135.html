<p>
<p>The examples just given were all basically of the form &quot;X <i>relation</i> Y&quot; where X and Y were specific names of things. For example,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the genie's lamp is carried by Cinderella ...
<br>if the genie's lamp is inside the cupboard ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Just as actions could be described with patterns to be matched (&quot;taking an open container&quot;, say), so can the positions of things. Giving subtler descriptions of our X and Y sometimes broadens the possibilities, sometimes narrows them:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the genie's lamp is carried by a woman ...
<br>if the genie's lamp is inside the closed cupboard ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In the first case, Y is allowed to be one of a whole range of things - any of the women existing in the world. This makes for a broader condition. In the second case, Y has not only to be the cupboard, but at a time when it is closed: which makes for a narrower condition. We can, of course, also vary X:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if an animal is inside the cupboard ...
<br>if a container is carried ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And we can even vary both X and Y at once:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if a woman is holding an animal ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>a condition which will be true if, anywhere in the game's world, any woman is holding any animal.
