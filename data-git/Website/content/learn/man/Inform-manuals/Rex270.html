<p>
<p>By default, examining an object shows its description, and - for devices - tells us whether the object is switched on or switched off.
<p>
<p>This kind of additional information is not always what we want, so if we have a device whose on/off status we want to conceal, we may write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The examine described devices rule is not listed in any rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>On the other hand, there are times when we may want to add a similar line or two to the descriptions of other kinds of objects. <b>Waxwork</b> shows how to make containers and supporters automatically list everything they're holding when examined, while <b>Crusoe</b> allows us to append an &quot;It is charred.&quot; sentence to the end of descriptions of things we have burned in the fire. Since it works by introducing a &quot;printing the description&quot; activity, Crusoe is also a good example to start from if we want to introduce more complex, flexible descriptions of items throughout our game.
<p>
<p><b>Odin</b> rewrites the &quot;You see nothing special...&quot; line with other text of our own, for items that otherwise do not have a description.
<p>
<p>Finally, we may want to look at multiple things at once. <b>The Left Hand of Autumn</b> demonstrates how we might provide a different response for EXAMINE PAINTINGS than for examining each individually; <b>Beekeeper's Apprentice</b> provides a SEARCH command that will show the descriptions of all the scenery in the current location.

<a name="e270"><a href=Rdoc33.html#e270 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 42:  Odin</b></a><br>Replacing "You see nothing special..." with a different default message for looking at something nondescript.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>In recent years there has been a strong trend towards providing unique descriptions for all implemented objects. Often this is a good idea, but there are also contexts in which we may want to discourage the player from looking too closely at some things and concentrate his attention on just a few interesting ones.
<p>
<p>The trick here is that leaving items completely undescribed leads to rather dull exchanges like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>x table
<br>You see nothing special about the table.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...which can leave the player with the impression that the author was simply too lazy to describe everything. So it can be a good idea to replace that default message with a different one more appropriate to the game. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Odin&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The House of a Mortal Farmer is a room. &quot;Having two separate rooms, this house testifies to considerable wealth and success at agriculture.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Bedroom is inside from the House.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A chair is a kind of supporter. A chair is always enterable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the House are a table, two chairs, a basket, and a hearth. On the table is a loaf of bread.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of a thing is usually &quot;You give [the noun] a glance, but it is plainly beneath your attention.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Because the description is attached to a whole kind (&quot;thing&quot;), it is really a blanket instruction about many objects at once. More specific instructions always override less specific ones, so we can easily make exceptions. For instance, the following will work correctly:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The infant is a man in the basket. The description of the infant is &quot;So strong and fat that you wonder whether one of your fellow gods is acquainted with the mistress of the house-- but it's no concern of yours, of course.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x table / x chair / x infant&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
