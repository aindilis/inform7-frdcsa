<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> (Two different activities here, but identical except for applying to different nouns.) Suppose that, because of an instruction to Understand something even though it would be lacking a noun - say, 'Understand &quot;take&quot; as taking.' - an incomplete action is generated, one which is required to have a noun, but doesn't. &quot;Supplying a missing noun&quot; takes place to remedy the problem. It can either:
<p>
<p>(i) Set a noun, printing text like &quot;(presumably the black bag)&quot; if it wants, in which case the action goes forward, though it is still subject to the full rules on accessibility exactly as any other action would be; or
<p>
<p>(ii) Make no choice, in which case no action takes place and the player's command is rejected. If the activity printed nothing, Inform will produce a generic reply to the player that &quot;You must supply a noun.&quot;.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> In the default grammar for Inform, only three such half-finished actions are ever Understood. One is &quot;going&quot; with no direction, for which this activity simply prints a refusal. The other two are the two undirected senses, &quot;smelling&quot; and &quot;listening&quot;. In each case, the &quot;supplying a missing noun&quot; activity sets the noun to the current location: so, for instance, typing the bare command &quot;listen&quot; might generate the action &quot;listening to the Shoreline&quot;.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) This is the definition Inform uses to make &quot;listen&quot; work as outlined above:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for supplying a missing noun while listening (this is the ambient sound rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun is the location.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(b) It can be elegant to allow second nouns to be dropped with habitual actions, or where the choice is obvious:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;unlock [something]&quot; as unlocking it with.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for supplying a missing second noun while unlocking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the skeleton key is carried, now the second noun is the skeleton key;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;You will have to specify what to unlock [the noun] with.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that, in order for our activity to succeed, we do need to supply a grammar line allowing the player to try &quot;unlocking it with&quot; using only one noun. Otherwise, the command &quot;unlock something&quot; will still produce the question &quot;What do you want to unlock the door with?&quot;

<p>
<p>Sometimes it would be nice to respond a little more sensitively to a vague command such as &quot;leave&quot; -- converting it, perhaps, to a &quot;go out&quot; command.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Minimal Movement&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Doll-like House is a room. The Postage-Stamp-Sized Garden is outside from the House.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for supplying a missing noun while going:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now noun is outside.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This particular situation is very slightly complicated by the existing rules about vague movement, but fortunately we can easily turn those off.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The block vaguely going rule is not listed in the for supplying a missing noun rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;go&quot;.
