<p><hr><img border=&quot;0&quot; src=images/beta.png id=&quot;betaoval&quot; style=&quot;height:31px; width=40px&quot;>This section and the previous one are about a feature which is being withdrawn from Inform in future. Experience shows there are equally good ways to achieve the same ends without needing procedural rules. As elegant as they were, they often confused users, and they were expensive at run-time (that is, they made everything work more slowly). Withdrawing them from Inform will make it possible to make more efficient story files, and will simplify the language.
<p>
<p>The &quot;ignore&quot; phrase is only one of a suite, <b>which should only be used in procedural rules</b>. The full list is:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #c00000; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>ignore </b>(rule)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_ignore_dep -->

<p>This phrase can only be used in procedural rules, which are now deprecated. It causes the named rule to be ignored (skipped over without producing a result) within the scope of the current &quot;follow&quot;.

<p>This phrase can only be used in procedural rules, which are now deprecated. Its only effect is to reverse the effect of any &quot;ignore&quot; phrase affecting the rule named.

<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #c00000; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>reject the result of </b>(rule)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_reject_dep -->

<p>This phrase can only be used in procedural rules, which are now deprecated. It causes the named rule to used, but to have its result ignored, within the scope of the current &quot;follow&quot;. In other words, if the rule succeeds or fails then this is suppressed and its rulebook continues.

<!-- definition of ph_movebefore_dep -->

<p>This phrase can only be used in procedural rules, which are now deprecated. This causes the first rule to be ignored whenever it turns up in the ordinary way, but to be invoked either immediately before the second rule whenever that second rule is invoked. In effect, it cuts out the first rule from wherever it was, and glues it onto the second. Note that there is no obligation for the first rule to begin in the same rulebook(s) as the second, so this can be used to slot in a wholly new rule, perhaps only if certain circumstances hold.

<p>These rule-changing instructions allow apparently casual sentences to wreak havoc with the model world. This, for instance, is quite the recipe for mayhem and perplexity:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A procedural rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reject the result of the before rules;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignore the after rules;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the after rules to before the before rules.

<p>
<p>This is a slight variation on the previous gas diffusion example: the main difference is that gas preferentially moves towards lower rooms, and will gradually settle in the bottom floor. We do this by calculating the probability of movement separately for each pair of rooms.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Lethal Concentration&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A concentration is a kind of value. 200.9ppm specifies concentration. 200.9 ppm specifies concentration.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A room has a concentration called current concentration. A room has a concentration called former concentration.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is the probability inverse between (space - a room) and (second space - a room):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let guess be 20;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let way be the best route from space to second space;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if way is up, let guess be 50;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if way is down, let guess be 10;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the guess is less than 10, decide on 10;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on guess.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we wanted, we could introduce other concerns into the calculation here: open and closed doors, windows between rooms, rooms that are outdoors vs. those that are indoors, and so on. The possibilities are numerous, so we will stick with the simple principle that our poison gas sinks.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow the diffusion rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The diffusion rules are a rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A diffusion rule (this is the gas movement rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with space running through rooms:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let sum be 0.0 ppm;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with way running through directions:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let second space be the room way from the space;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if second space is a room:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let incoming be the former concentration of the second space divided by the probability inverse between second space and space;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let outgoing be the former concentration of the space divided by the probability inverse between space and second space;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let difference be incoming minus outgoing;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase sum by the difference;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now current concentration of the space is the former concentration of the space plus the sum.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with space running through rooms:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the former concentration of the space is the current concentration of the space.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The last diffusion rule (this is the lethal dosage rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the current concentration of the location is greater than LC50:

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing something when the current concentration of the location is greater than TLV-STEL:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if going, continue the action;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can't work in this environment: your eyes and nose sting and it hurts to breathe.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
