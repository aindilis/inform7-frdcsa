Looking Under and Hiding</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Finding hidden objects is a classic puzzle in IF. <b>Beachfront</b> provides the most basic example, an object that becomes visible only when we have searched the papers on a cluttered desk. <b>Beneath the Surface</b> takes this further, giving all large furnishings the ability to conceal items, and allowing the player to put things underneath other things, as well as find them. <b>Flashlight</b> adds an extra twist to the puzzle by requiring that the player have a flashlight to shine under a bulky object in order to find what lies underneath.
<p>
<p>Looking inside an object is generally handled by the searching action, and we could extend that to allow the player to search multiple or complex objects. <b>Matreshka</b> turns the puzzle on its head by allowing the player to search a whole room systematically with only a single command.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is carrying a lit thing (called lamp):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You shine [the lamp] under [the noun]...&quot;;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the marble to the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the marble is found;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Billy's lost marble! So that's where it got to!&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;look under cabinet / get lantern / look under cabinet&quot;.

<p>
<p>Because visibility is checked before instead rules, this discovery will (correctly) occur only when the player does have enough light.
