Memory and Knowledge</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>All of us carry around in our heads an (incomplete, imperfect) model of the world around us: an idea of where we left the keys, whether the oven is on or off, how many clean pairs of socks are left in the drawer, what we look like in our best pair of jeans. The differences between that mental model and reality are to some degree a reflection of personal character: our forgetfulness, our wishful thinking, our innocence or cynicism.
<p>
<p>By default, Inform does not keep track of the player character's knowledge (or any other character's knowledge, for that matter) as a separate thing from the model world, relying on descriptive prose rather than modeling to introduce these quirks of characterization.
<p>
<p>All the same, there are often times when we would like to keep track of discrepancies between the world model and the narrator's mental model. Perhaps the most common way to do this is simply to mark everything that the player encounters as &quot;seen&quot; when the player first examines it, thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be seen or unseen.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out examining a thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun is seen.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>or -- to have things remembered from the first moment they're mentioned in a room description:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of something (called the target):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the target is seen.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The mental model need not always be accurate, of course. We might, for instance, have occasion to keep track of where the player character last saw something, even if the object has since been moved; or keep track of falsehoods the player character has been told in conversation; or make the player refer to a character as &quot;the bearded man&quot; until he is properly introduced. There are even extensions for Inform that provide some possible models for tracking player knowledge systematically.
<p>
<p>Modeling what the player does and does not know is only half the job, of course: we also need a way for that information to affect the behavior of the game in plausible ways.
<p>
<p>One obvious occasion to use player character knowledge is in the output of descriptions. We might want to respond to actions differently depending on what the player has previously done, as in <b>Tense Boxing</b>, or change the way we describe objects in light of new knowledge about them, as in <b>Zero</b>. <b>Casino Banale</b> takes that idea much further, with a whole system of facts that can be narrated to the player in a somewhat flexible but interdependent order, as the player looks at relevant objects or notices them in room descriptions.
<p>
<p>Along similar lines, we may want an object to change its name for the player depending on what the player knows. That name change should affect both what Inform displays and what it understands about the object. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An Amherz Amulet is a thing. It can be known or unknown. It is privately-named.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The printed name is &quot;[if known]Amherz Amulet[otherwise]lizard-shaped pewter charm[end if]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description is &quot;[if known]It's a unique and magically powerful pewter charm shaped like a lizard[otherwise]It's some cheap tacky pewter charm shaped like a lizard. At least, as far as you can tell -- it's pretty grubby[end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;amherz&quot; or &quot;amulet&quot; as the Amulet when the Amulet is known.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;lizard&quot; or &quot;lizard-shaped&quot; or &quot;pewter&quot; or &quot;charm&quot; as the Amulet when the Amulet is unknown.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of rubbing the amulet when the amulet is unknown:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;You rub off a bit of the dirt, and... what do you know? It's actually the priceless and fabulously powerful Amherz Amulet!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the Amherz Amulet is known.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Finally, the player's knowledge may affect how the game interprets commands, in the determining what is called &quot;scope&quot;. When Inform tries to make sense of something the player has typed, it makes a list of everything that the player is allowed to refer to at the moment, and then checks whether all of the objects in the player's command refer to items in that list. Only things that are &quot;in scope&quot; are open for discussion.
<p>
<p>If the player mentions an object that is not &quot;in scope&quot; -- say, a red hat left behind in the next room -- Inform will issue the response &quot;You can't see any such thing.&quot; This is also Inform's reply if the player mentions a nonsense object (&quot;EXAMINE FURSZWIGGLE&quot;) or an object that does not exist in the game world at all (&quot;EXAMINE CELL PHONE&quot; in a game set in Carolingian France).
<p>
<p>This is not the only possible way for interactive fiction to handle such communication. Some games will respond differently to EXAMINE RED HAT and EXAMINE FURSZWIGGLE, saying in the first case something like &quot;You can't see that now&quot; and in the second &quot;I don't know the word 'furszwiggle'.&quot;
<p>
<p>The drawback of such behavior is that the player can make premature discoveries. If he hasn't found a sword yet, but thinks there may be a sword later in the game, he can type EXAMINE SWORD and see from the response whether his guess is correct. Nonetheless, there are people who prefer this alternative exactly because it does expose the limits of the game's understanding, preventing fruitless attempts to use a word that is not recognized at all. If it is desirable, there is an extension that will reproduce this behavior in Inform as well.
<p>
<p>Using Inform's default behavior, however, scope is an ad-hoc way of keeping a list of things that are common knowledge between the game and the player. The player knows many things that the game might not (like what a cell phone is); the game knows a few things the player may not (like the fact that there is a sword in an as-yet unvisited room). Neither of those things can fruitfully enter into commands because they have no mutually agreed-upon referent.
<p>
<p>By default, Inform assumes that &quot;scope&quot; includes only those things that are currently visible by line of sight. This works pretty well for a wide range of situations, but there are still plenty of occasions when we want to admit that the game and the player share a knowledge of things not seen. GO TO THE KITCHEN might be a useful command even when the player can't currently view the kitchen. ASK FRED ABOUT THE FOOTPRINTS should perhaps work even when the footprints are far away in the garden. SMELL STINKY CHEESE might need to work even when the cheese is invisibly locked away in a porous container but is exuding a stench. In a dark room, the player can't see his own inventory, but he should still remember that he's carrying it and be able to mention it. And sometimes we might want the game to acknowledge that the player is referring to an object that he has seen somewhere, even if that thing is now out of sight.
<p>
<p>In practice, we have two ways to tinker with scope: we can change the scope for a specific command, using a token with any, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;go to [any room]&quot; as approaching.
<br>Understand &quot;find [any thing]&quot; as finding.
<br>Understand &quot;ask [someone] about [any known thing]&quot; as interrogating it about.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Or we can add areas and items to scope for all commands, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player when the surveillance camera is switched on:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place the jail cell in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>

<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>In a work of interactive fiction that involves many new discoveries, we might want to change the way we narrate room descriptions and describe objects as the player learns new information.
<p>
<p>One approach to this is to create a model of the facts we want the player to find out, and attach some narrative text to each. When a fact becomes relevant to the story, that narrative text is shown to the player. So:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Casino Banale&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 1 - Procedure
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>First we create the concept of facts, and the idea that facts can make some things more important than others.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A fact is a kind of thing. A fact can be known or unknown. A fact can be ready to learn or hidden. A fact has some text called the narration.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is narratively significant if it conveys an interesting fact.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is narratively dull if it is not narratively significant.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Conveyance relates various things to various facts. The verb to convey (it conveys, they convey, it conveyed, it is conveyed, it is conveying) implies the conveyance relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a fact is interesting if it is unknown and it is ready to learn.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now, we also need a way to tell Inform to introduce certain new facts when the right previous ones have been introduced. We'll create a &quot;following&quot; relation, according to which a new fact can be told to the player when the player has already learned all the facts it follows. This way, we can simulate the effect of putting together several pieces of evidence to come to a conclusion:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Following relates various facts to various facts. The verb to follow (it follows, they follow, it followed, it is followed, it is following) implies the following relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say (new fact - a fact):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[narration of the new fact]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the new fact is known;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with possible outcome running through facts which follow the new fact:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if every fact which is followed by possible outcome is known:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the possible outcome is ready to learn.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Next we need a way for the game to introduce these new facts. Let's say we want them to come up when the player examines something appropriate, or sees it in the room:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After examining something which conveys an interesting fact (called discovery):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[discovery][paragraph break]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After choosing notable locale objects:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat through the Table of Locale Priorities:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the notable-object entry is narratively significant:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set the locale priority of the notable-object entry to 1.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">For writing a paragraph about a narratively significant thing (called item):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the item is mentioned;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let chosen fact be a random interesting fact which is conveyed by the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[chosen fact][paragraph break]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;after choosing notable locale objects&quot; line here handles things so that any interesting conclusions we want to draw are always given first, followed by the less interesting description.
<p>
<p>And finally, we need to give the player a little evidence to piece together:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 2 - Scenario
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Casino is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Frince is a man in the Casino. The description is &quot;Frince is a friend of yours -- if you reckon friendship on the same terms that one reckons a cat as a pet. He spends time with you when he wants to, but if your wishes or convenience ever run counter to a whim of his, it's the whim that wins. Always. [paragraph break]He's also wearing a somewhat ludicrous shirt.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Frince wears a ludicrous shirt. The description of the ludicrous shirt is &quot;Fine white fabric with satiny white pinstripes: it's that expensive, effeminate look that Frince is so fond of, and which -- combined with his name -- gives people completely the wrong idea about him.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Tim is a man in the Casino. The description is &quot;You don't know Tim well. Kind of wall-flowerish. The only thing that seems to excite him is craps.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Penny is a woman in the Casino. The description is &quot;Loud. Brash. Hot, probably, if you can look past the loud and brash.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about a narratively dull person:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let is-are-n be &quot;is&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of unmentioned narratively dull people is not 1:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let is-are-n be &quot;are&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[A list of unmentioned narratively dull people] [is-are-n] [one of]watching the croupier[or]following the spin of the roulette[or]chattering[at random][one of] breathlessly[or] impatiently[or][at random].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Penny-annoying is a fact.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ready to learn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narration is &quot;[if looking]Penny grimaces at you-- [end if]Penny is the same woman who stepped on your toe in the buffet line. The third time, she blurted, 'You have big shoes, don't you?'&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny conveys penny-annoying.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">lipstick-smudges is a fact.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ready to learn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narration is &quot;There are a couple of smudges of coral-colored lipstick on the collar.&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ludicrous shirt conveys lipstick-smudges.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">penny-wears-coral is a fact.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows penny-annoying.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narration is &quot;[if looking]Penny catches your eye again. [end if]The bright coral lipstick was really not a wise choice.&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny conveys penny-wears-coral.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Affair-with-penny is a fact.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows lipstick-smudges and penny-wears-coral.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narration is &quot;You avoid [if examining Frince]his[otherwise]Frince's[end if] eye. You need some time to adjust to the image of him making out with Penny in a storage closet before you can talk to him without appalled giggling.&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frince conveys affair-with-Penny.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x penny / x frince / x shirt / look&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
