Scripted Scenes</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Sometimes we want to arrange a scene in which something goes on in the background (as though it were a movie playing) while the player goes about his business; or where a series of things has to happen before the player gets to the end.
<p>
<p>The simplest way to arrange background events for a scene is to write the sequence of events into a table and work our way through it, printing one line per turn, until the scene runs out. <b>Day One</b> does exactly this.
<p>
<p>At other times, we want a scene to last as long as it takes the <i>player</i> to do something. <b>Entrapment</b> lets the player poke around and explore as much as he likes, but ends as soon as he has accomplished the scene's goal - which, unfortunately for him, is to get into an embarrassing situation so that another character can walk in and make fun of him. <b>The Prague Job</b> has a scene that requires the player to do a more specific set of tasks, but nags him and hurries him along until he's done.
<p>
<p><b>Bowler Hats and Baby Geese</b> assumes that our game is going to be assembled with a number of scenes, some of which will need to prevent the player from leaving the location until the scene is complete: it thus defines a &quot;restricted&quot; property for scenes, so that all such elements of the plot will work in the same way.
<p>
<p>For more complex sorts of scripts and schedules, it may be worth consulting the extensions.

<p>Suppose we want to remind the player that he doesn't have all the time in the world, by starting to nag him when he's nearly, but not entirely, done going over his inventory in preparation for a job.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a lockpick, a smoke bomb, a grappling hook, and a pair of gloves. The description of the lockpick is &quot;Effective on most kinds of key locks, it is a gift from your mentor in the discipline, old Wheezy.&quot; The description of the smoke bomb is &quot;Your last of these, so you should rely on it only when other modes of escape have vanished. It takes effect when dropped, producing a cloud of purple haze sufficient to fill a medium-sized room.&quot; The description of the grappling hook is &quot;Good for shooting at balconies and other sorts of overhang.&quot;  The gloves are wearable. The description of the gloves is &quot;Black and shiny, with gripping material on the palms. Batman would be jealous.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Toilet is a room. &quot;The walls are painted an unattractive green; the fixtures are a bit old. But it is the only place in the hostel with any privacy.&quot; The Long Hallway is outside from the Toilet.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Escalating Danger begins: say &quot;Someone pounds on the door of your hideout and yells at you in Czech.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
