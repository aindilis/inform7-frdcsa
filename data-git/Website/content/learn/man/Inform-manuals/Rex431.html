<p>The simplest form of clock is a wrist watch. Here is a choice of analogue or digital:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player wears a wrist watch. The description of the wrist watch is &quot;It is [the time of day in words].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player wears a digital watch. The description of the digital watch is &quot;It is [the time of day].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Better clocks would allow us also to set the time, and to stop and start them: see <b>Tom's Midnight Garden</b>.
<p>
<p>Scientific instruments provide sharper versions of our own senses. In the case of vision, they allow us to see closer up, or further away. It's a convention of IF that people can normally see only the current location, that is, they cannot see from one location into another. The boundary of the current room is like a horizon, even out of doors (though it's true that there are ways to disguise that with a continuous outdoor landscape). <b>Ginger Beer</b> provides a telescope able to see into other rooms.
<p>
<p><b>Witnessed 2</b> provides a meter which measures how close a ghost is to the player.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a device called a Trifield Natural EMF Meter. The description of the Meter is &quot;This cost a pretty penny off the internet, but it's worth it: according to the website it has been programmed by PhD physicists to ignore manmade sources of fields and to respond only to paranormal EMF changes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">It also features an optional Tone Alarm, which can be turned on to indicate when readings spike. If the alarm is off, the meter just reads out the magnetic and electric field levels on a scale from 0-100 microteslas, or 0-1000 V/m.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Since both fields are important, you keep the meter set to SUM mode. The meter has its own optional backlighting, so that you can see the reading even if your flashlight is off. Currently it is reading at [meter setting].&quot; A Tone Alarm is part of the Meter. It is a device. The description of the Tone Alarm is &quot;The Tone Alarm will make a noise, if the EMF picks up a spike.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is meter setting:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the meter is switched off, decide on 0;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a ghost is touchable, decide on 35;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a ghost is visible, decide on 12;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on 0.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After switching on the meter:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You turn on the meter. The needle steadies at [meter setting].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn: if the meter setting is greater than 10 and the Tone Alarm is switched on, say &quot;[The Tone Alarm] shrieks.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Thirtieth Street Station is a room. &quot;A huge, high, rectangular room with coffered ceilings, which looks grand but mostly makes you feel lonely and small. There are long benches in rows down the middle of the room, and an information desk with the train times, and a series of ticket windows, none of which matters very much at the moment.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The benches are an enterable supporter. They are scenery in the Station. The information desk is scenery in the Station. Some ticket windows are scenery in the Station. Instead of examining scenery in the Station: say &quot;You're fairly sure that whatever is going on here has nothing to do with [the noun].&quot; Understand &quot;window&quot; as ticket windows.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The mural is fixed in place in Thirtieth Street. &quot;At the north side of the station is a particularly pointless and empty annex to the main room. It is dominated by a huge relief of sorts, and this is what you remember.&quot; Understand &quot;metal&quot; or &quot;relief&quot; or &quot;huge&quot; as the mural. The description of the mural is &quot;It is both stylized and confusing, but you think it might be supposed to represent the various tasks and occupations of Philadelphia's population. The portions closer to the ground look as though they have recently been subjected to a light dusting of talcum powder. No unusual prints are evident.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The wind chimes are fixed in place in Thirtieth Street. &quot;Carefully attached to the wall with a piece of duct tape and a hook is a light-weight set of wind chimes. Someone else has been here before you, it seems.&quot; The description is &quot;Several of your friends use wind chimes as a sort of ghost alarm, since ghosts sometimes cause very localized movements of air when there is no natural breeze.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A ghost is a kind of person. The pale figure is a ghost.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 9:03 AM: move the pale figure to the location; say &quot;You shiver with some sort of presence.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;turn on alarm / turn on meter / z / z / z / x figure&quot;.
