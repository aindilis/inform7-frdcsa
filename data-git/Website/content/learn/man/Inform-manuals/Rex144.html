<p>
<p>Sometimes we want Inform to apply a player's action to a different target than the one specified: for instance, directing all (or almost all) commands from the doorknob to the door of which it is a part. <b>Fine Laid</b> demonstrates how to do this. Along the same lines, <b>Lucy</b> shows how to direct a player's conversation action to apply to a new conversation topic.
<p>
<p>We can also record a series of actions performed by the player or by another character.
<p>
<p><b>Cactus Will Outlive Us All</b> demonstrates characters each of whom reacts to a very specific provocation; <b>I Didn't Come All The Way From Great Portland Street</b> implements a game show in which the player is not allowed ever to repeat an action he has already performed; and <b>Leopard-skin</b> implements a maze which the player can escape only by performing a specific sequence of actions.
<p>
<p><b>Anteaters</b> provides a peculiar gizmo that can remember actions performed in its presence and force the player to reiterate them.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e144"><a href=Rdoc42.html#e144 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 88:  Fine Laid</b></a><br>Making writing that can be separately examined from the paper on which it appears, but which directs all other actions to the paper.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to direct all -- or almost all -- actions from one object to another. For the sake of argument, say we have a sheet of paper with writing on it, and (because we're very meticulous) we want to let the player examine the writing and get a customized response, different from when he just examines the sheet of paper. But for all other purposes -- say, TAKE or TASTE -- we want the two objects to be treated as one.
<p>
<p>Here, we approach the problem by changing the noun and/or the second noun of the current action, then issuing a new command to &quot;try the current action&quot;. Because we've changed the noun and second noun, the &quot;current action&quot; at this point is different from the one generated originally by the player's command.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The sheet of paper is a thing in High Street Stationer. The writing is part of the sheet of paper.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the sheet of paper is &quot;A beautiful sheet of heavy cream paper.&quot; The description of the writing is &quot;Delicate and spidery.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of tasting the sheet of paper, say &quot;You might need more fiber in your diet, but this isn't the way.&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before doing something other than examining when the current action involves the writing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the writing is the noun, now the noun is the sheet of paper;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the writing is the second noun, now the second noun is the sheet of paper;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try the current action instead.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;examine sheet of paper / examine writing / get writing / taste writing&quot;.
