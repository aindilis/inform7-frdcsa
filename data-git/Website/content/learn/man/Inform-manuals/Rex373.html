<p>
<p>By default, Inform gives the player character (and every other person) a simple unitary body, one without hands or feet or any other defined parts. In many games this is adequate; but in others it is not enough, and we may want to endow all people with some more specific physical features, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A face is a kind of thing. A face is part of every person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Once we've done this, we may invite ambiguities if the player types LOOK AT FACE; it is this challenge that is addressed in <b>The Night Before</b>.
<p>
<p><b>rBGH</b> gives the player a random height and then uses this to determine how the room should be described around him.
<p>
<p><b>Slouching</b> lets the player (and other characters as well) take different sitting, standing, and lying down positions.
