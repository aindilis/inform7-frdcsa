<p>
<p>We have now seen several different forms of &quot;Understand&quot; sentence: for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the colour property as describing a building block.
<br>Understand &quot;mix [colour] paint&quot; as mixing paint.
<br>Understand &quot;rouge&quot; as red.
<br>Understand &quot;curious girl&quot; as Alice.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Any of these may optionally have a condition tacked on: for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;mix [colour] paint&quot; as mixing paint when the location is the Workshop.
<br>Understand &quot;rouge&quot; as red when the make-up set is visible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In principle, &quot;when ...&quot; can take in any condition at all. In practice a little care should be exercised not to do anything too slow, or which might have side-effects. (For instance, referring the decision to a phrase which then printed text up would be a bad idea.) Moreover, we must remember that the &quot;noun&quot; and &quot;second noun&quot; are not known yet, nor do we know what the action will be. So we cannot safely say &quot;when the noun is the fir cone&quot;, for instance, or refer to things like &quot;the number understood&quot;. (We aren't done understanding yet.) If we want more sophisticated handling of such cases, we need to write checking rules and so on in the usual way.
<p>
<p>Contexts can be useful to make sense of things having different names depending on who is being spoken to, as here:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;your&quot; as a thing when the item described is held by the person asked.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>With this rule in place FRODO, GIVE ME YOUR RING means that Frodo will know which ring is meant, even if there are a couple of dozen other rings present.
<p>
<p>If the name of something has to change completely, perhaps because the player's understanding of events has changed completely, then Inform's standard way of handling names can be a nuisance. When an item or room is created, Inform automatically makes its name understood as referring to it (in fact, it makes each individual word in that name understood). For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Wabe is a room. The blue peacock and the sundial are in the Wabe.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>means that the player can type EXAMINE BLUE PEACOCK or PUSH SUNDIAL or SHOWME WABE or TAKE BLUE, and so on. This is almost always a good thing, and here there's no problem, because peacocks and sundials are not usually disguised. But here is a case where a disguise is needed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The secret document is a privately-named thing in the drawer.
<br>The printed name of the secret document is &quot;[if the secret document is handled]secret document[otherwise]dusty paper&quot;.
<br>Understand &quot;dusty&quot; and &quot;paper&quot; as the secret document.
<br>Understand &quot;secret&quot; and &quot;document&quot; as the secret document when the secret document is handled.
<br>After taking the secret document for the first time: say &quot;Heavens! It is the secret document!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>As this demonstrates, the either/or property &quot;privately-named&quot; makes Inform create a thing or room which starts out with no automatic understandings at all. The name it happens to have in the source text is ignored. If we simply write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The ungraspable concept is a privately-named thing in the Dining Room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then nothing the player can type will ever refer to it; though he will see it, and even be able to pick it up by typing TAKE ALL.
<p>
<p>The reverse property is &quot;publically-named&quot;, which all things and rooms are by default.
<p>
<p>(Privately-named is a property which only affects how Inform creates the object, and it can't usefully be given or taken away during play. &quot;Understand ... when ...&quot; is the way to change names during play.)
