<p>
<p>Suppose we want to coin a word for supporters currently supporting something. We can do so with the following sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: A supporter is occupied if something is on it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note the colon, which is essential, and the usage of &quot;it&quot; in the definition part to refer to the object in question. (For this purpose we would write &quot;it&quot; even if we were defining a term about, say, a woman instead of a supporter, so that &quot;she&quot; or &quot;her&quot; might seem more appropriate - but see below.)
<p>
<p>This creates the adjective &quot;occupied&quot;, and gives it a definition valid for supporters. That restriction on validity means that non-supporters would always fail the description &quot;something occupied&quot;; which might be unfortunate if we wanted to walk about rooms being occupied. We could give a second definition thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: A room is occupied if a person is in it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These are entirely different senses of the word &quot;occupied&quot; - a mantelpiece is occupied if an invitation is on it, but for a drawing room to be occupied there must be human presence - and Inform applies whichever sense is relevant when deciding whether or not a given object is &quot;occupied&quot;.
<p>
<p>Often, though not always, we also want to give a name to the opposite possibility. We can do that as follows:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: A room is occupied rather than unoccupied if a person is in it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;rather than...&quot; part of the definition is optional, but it saves having to write a boringly similar definition of &quot;unoccupied&quot; out in longhand.
<p>
<p>Newly defined adjectives cannot be used when creating things, because they are not explicit enough. Inform could not satisfy:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Ballroom is occupied. The bucket is a large container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because there is not enough information: by whom is the Ballroom occupied? How large, exactly? On the other hand, newly defined adjectives are very helpful in conditions and for rules, as we shall see later on.
<p>
<p>It is occasionally clumsy having to refer to the subject of a definition using &quot;it&quot;. We can avoid this and give the definition better legibility by supplying a name instead. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a direction (called thataway) is viable if the room thataway from the location is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which is a good deal easier to read than
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a direction is viable if the room it from the location is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>

<a name="e145"><a href=doc89.html#e145 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 73:  Finishing School</b></a><br>The "another" adjective for rules such as "in the presence of another person".<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>It is often useful to write action rules which apply only when the player is observed by a third party. &quot;In the presence of a person&quot;, however, will react even if only the player is in the room, because the player is, of course, a person as well.
<p>
<p>A convenient way around this problem is to define an &quot;other&quot; adjective:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Finishing School&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The apple is an edible thing carried by the player.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Hall is a room. Miss Wicket is a woman in the Hall.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Dormitory is south of the Hall.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a person is another if it is not the player.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of eating something in the presence of another person:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Your mannerly upbringing prevents you from eating without a fork or knife in front of someone.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;eat apple / south / eat apple&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we did not have &quot;another&quot; here, Inform would interpret even the player as a possible schoolmarm, leading to such lines as &quot;yourself stares at you coldly...&quot;. Clearly not quite the thing.
