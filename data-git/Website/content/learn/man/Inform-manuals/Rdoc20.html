<p>
<p>In a plot that takes place over multiple locations or has several distinct scenes, we may want to move the player or change the scenery around him. <b>Age of Steam</b> brings a train on and off-stage as the plot requires. <b>Meteoric</b> similarly brings a meteor into view at a certain time of day, showing off several implementations depending on whether or not the player is supposed to be able to refer to the meteor after it has gone.
<p>
<p><b>Entrevaux</b> constructs an organized system such that all scenes have their own lists of props and associated locations, and props are moved on and off automatically. Scene changes are also announced with a pause and a new title, such as &quot;Chapter 2: Abduction&quot;.
<p>
<p><b>Space Patrol - Stranded on Jupiter</b> inserts an interlude in which the player's possessions and clothes are switched for new ones and the player moved to a new location - and then put back where he started from.
