Actions as conditions</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>There are two ways that descriptions of actions can be used as conditions. First, we can simply describe an action, and then the condition will be true if that is what the player is trying to do, and not otherwise:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if taking a container, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is actually an abbreviation for the longer, some would say preferable form:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if we are taking a container, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Secondly, we can talk about the past as well as the present, which is very useful since interactive fiction often contains situations which are changed by earlier events.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting when we have taken the lantern, say &quot;No, your acquisitive nature is roused now, and simply waiting will no longer do.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>More on the past tense later follows in the next section: note that &quot;we are taking&quot; has become &quot;we have taken&quot;. For the rule to apply, it is not enough that the action &quot;taking the lantern&quot; has been tried: it must have succeeded.

<p>
<p>The names of objects might want to change also:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Zero&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Weight is a kind of value. The weights are light, manageable, and horribly heavy. Everything has a weight.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing is usually manageable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This does require a rule from Chapter 16, but it's a fairly straightforward one:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before printing the name of a horribly heavy thing (called weighty object):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if we have taken the weighty object, say &quot;[weight] &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Nearly Empty Living Room is a room. &quot;Nearly everything is out, all of Helen's possessions and most of yours.&quot; A man called Mr Zero is in the Nearly Empty Living Room. &quot;Mr Zero, despite being heavily paid to assist in this operation, is giving you a look that clearly conveys his lack of interest in budging even one more item.&quot; The description of Mr Zero is &quot;Many muscles, no hair.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The book box is a horribly heavy thing in the Living Room. The clothing box is a manageable thing in the Living Room. A broom, a dustpan, some packing tape, and a discarded newspaper are light things in the Living Room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After taking a horribly heavy thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Taken. (Oof.)&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;get clothing / look / get book box / look / i / drop book box / look&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
