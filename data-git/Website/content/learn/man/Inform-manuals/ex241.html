<p>
<p>Adding to the previous example game, we apply rules which depend on travelling by a particular vehicle:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The book trolley is in the Musicology Section. &quot;The book trolley, a sort of motorised tractor for trundling around through the stacks, is parked here.&quot; The trolley is a vehicle. Instead of going nowhere by the trolley, say &quot;Don't go crashing the trolley into walls.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going to the Front Stacks by the trolley, say &quot;The Front Stacks are far too confined for the trolley to manoeuvre into them.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And, lastly, rules which apply to movements through particular doors:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The green baize door is east of the Catalogue Room and west of the Clerk's Office. The green baize door is an open door.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before going through the green baize door, say &quot;Through you go...&quot; After going through the green baize door: try looking; say &quot;...and here you are.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Note that these apply whether the action is &quot;going east&quot; or &quot;entering the green baize door&quot;, each having the same effect.) The last rule is worth a second look: the normal way that a &quot;going&quot; action is reported is to produce the room description of the new location. So if an &quot;after&quot; rule stops the action before we get to reporting, we have to produce any room description by hand (hence the &quot;try looking&quot; to cause the looking action). Alternatively, we could simply say something and let the normal course of events take place:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After going through the green baize door: say &quot;...and here you are:&quot;; continue the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Finally, going is an action which can also happen while the player is pushing something from one room to another, and we can describe this like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going from the Office with the trolley, say &quot;But it looks perfectly placed here. Why push any further?&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Going&quot; is not the only action which moves the player. Another is &quot;exiting&quot;, an action which moves the player out of whatever he/she is currently in or on. This action is often caused by the player typing just OUT or GET DOWN, and there's no noun as such. But Inform allows the syntax &quot;exiting from&quot; to make it easier to write rules about the exiting of particular containers or supporters:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After exiting from the Mini Cooper:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You painstakingly unpack your limbs from the tiny car.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>By default, when the player pushes something a direction, Inform checks to make sure that the object is pushable between rooms. If not, it blocks the action; if so, it carries out a normal going action with the pushed object taken along.
<p>
<p>Also by default, this action produces only a description of the new room that we've traveled into. But suppose we would like to print a short message describing the pushing action first:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;Mattress King&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Monica's Bedroom is a room. The Living Room is south of Monica's Bedroom. Rachel's Bedroom is south of the Living Room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After going a direction (called way-pushed) with something (called the thing-pushed):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You push [the thing-pushed] [way-pushed] to [the location].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The race car bed is an enterable supporter in Monica's Bedroom. It is pushable between rooms.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;push bed south&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
