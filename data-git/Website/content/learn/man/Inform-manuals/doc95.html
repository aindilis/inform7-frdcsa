<p>
<p>&quot;There&quot; is a curious word in English, which mostly refers to some place which is being talked about - but which can sometimes mean the whole world. In Ian Fleming's novel &quot;From Russia With Love&quot;, a chapter narrating a committee meeting of SMERSH officers in Istanbul ends with one of the Russians saying:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">There is a man called Bond.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>What does this &quot;there&quot; mean? It really just means that Bond exists. In fact, he's watching the meeting through a concealed periscope, but the SMERSH general doesn't know that. All he is saying is that Bond is out there somewhere, and is not imaginary, or dead.
<p>
<p>Inform also allows &quot;there is&quot; (or &quot;there are&quot;) to talk about what exists, or does not. This is especially useful if, for some reason, we don't want to give a name to something. For example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">There is a door in the Summerhouse.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Another reason might be that we want to create something but not put it anywhere. If Inform reads the sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">There is a man called Bond.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then it creates a man, gives him the name Bond, but places him initially off-stage - not in any room, that is, but available to be brought into play later on, like an actor who is not needed until Act II.
<p>
<p>&quot;There&quot; also provides a useful way to test what exists:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if there is a woman in the Summerhouse, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Or even:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if there is a woman, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which will be true if the model world contains even a single woman, on-stage or off. The alternative &quot;there are&quot; can also be used:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if there are women in the Summerhouse, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but note that this does not necessarily imply more than one woman is present, despite the plural. If we want that, we have to be more explicit:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if there is more than one woman in the Summerhouse, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>or, of course, we needn't use &quot;there is&quot; at all:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if more than one woman is in the Summerhouse, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And we can also test non-existence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if there is nobody in the Summerhouse, ...
<br>if there is nothing on the mantelpiece, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
