<p>
<p>We often want to arrange for something to happen at some point in the future. Here is yet another timepiece:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An egg-timer is in the Chamber. &quot;A plastic egg timer in the shape of a chicken can be pressed to set it going.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of pushing the egg-timer:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;It begins to mark time.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At the time when the egg-timer clucks:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Cluck! Cluck! Cluck! says the egg-timer.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The event here is called &quot;the egg-timer clucks&quot;. It only happens if we instruct so, using one of the following phrases:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b></b>(rule)<b> in </b>(time)<b> from now</b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_timefromnow -->

<p>This phrase causes the given rule to be run at a given time offset from the current time of day. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the egg-timer clucks in 18 minutes from now;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b></b>(rule)<b> in </b>(number)<b> turn</b>/turns<b> from now</b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_turnsfromnow -->

<p>This phrase causes the given rule to be run at a given number of turns after the current one. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b></b>(rule)<b> at </b>(time)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_attime -->

<p>This phrase causes the given rule to be run at a given time of day. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the egg-timer clucks at 11:35 AM;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>If we know in advance what time we want something to happen, we can more simply write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 4 PM: say &quot;The great bells of the clock tower chime four.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Note that in either case such rules begin with the word &quot;at&quot;: they are the only rules allowed to begin with the word &quot;at&quot;.)

<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we want to have a train which, at fixed times, arrives at and leaves stations. It should be possible for the player to get on and off the train when it is stopped, but not while the train is in motion.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Empire&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Empire Builder Train is a room. The Train has a room called the station. The station of the Train is Seattle.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the Empire Builder is &quot;One of the (relatively) plush long-distance Amtrak trains. You're in a two-story car with toilets and a cafe at one end, not having sprung for a sleeper.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">[if the station of the Train is the train]Outside the window there is rapidly-passing countryside.[otherwise]Through the windows you can see the [station of the Train] train station.[end if]&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of exiting when the player is in the Train:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the station of the Train is the Train:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The train is not stopped at a station.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the player to the station of the train instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before going outside when the player is in the Train:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try exiting instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before going inside when the player is in the station of the Train:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the player to the Train instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Seattle, Edmonds, Everett, Wenatchee, and Spokane are rooms. The description of a room is usually &quot;The scenic train station of [the location][if the location is the station of the train].
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The pompously-titled Empire Builder train is pulled up here, soon to continue its journey towards Chicago[end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now our schedule for the train -- somewhat truncated, admittedly, since the full three-day journey from Seattle to Chicago is a bit long even for an ambitious example.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 4:45 PM:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is in the train or the player is in the station of the train, say &quot;The train pulls out of [the station of the Train]!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the station of the Train is the Train.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 5:10 PM:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the station of the Train is Edmonds;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is in the train or the player is in the station of the train, say &quot;The train pulls into Edmonds and comes to a stop.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 5:17 PM:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is in the train or the player is in the station of the train, say &quot;The train pulls out of [the station of the Train], running north along the shore towards Everett.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the station of the Train is the Train.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 5:39 PM:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the station of the Train is Everett;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is in the train or the player is in the station of the train, say &quot;The train arrives in scenic Everett, WA: the last stop before it turns east and heads over the mountains.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 5:44 PM:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is in the train or the player is in the station of the train, say &quot;The train pulls out of [the station of the Train] and turns east.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the station of the Train is the Train.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 8:39 PM:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is in the train or the player is in the station of the train, say &quot;In darkness the train rolls into Wenatchee; which is just fine, considering that there is nothing to see here at all.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the station of the Train is Wenatchee.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 8:44 PM:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is in the train or the player is in the station of the train, say &quot;The train pulls out of [the station of the Train] and continues east through the darkness towards Spokane.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the station of the Train is the Train.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Playing this out would of course require near inhuman patience. Let's set things up so that the player at least doesn't have to wait too long for his first departure:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The time of day is 4:43 PM.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...and provide fair warning of how slowly time is elapsing.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the right hand status line is &quot;[time of day]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;out / in / z/ z / z / out / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / out / in / out / z / z&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test more with &quot;out / z/ z / z  / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
