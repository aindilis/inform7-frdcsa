<p>
<p>This seems a good point to see what we can with new kinds. Here we invent a new kind to provide a new sort of room:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is a kind of room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Any dead end that we make is also a room, so it has all of the properties and behaviour of a room. For instance, every room is either &quot;lighted&quot; or &quot;dark&quot;, and the default is to be lighted. But we can reverse that convention for dead ends, and we can also fill in some other properties:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is a kind of room with printed name &quot;Dead End&quot; and description &quot;This is a dead end. You'll have to go back the way you came.&quot; A dead end is usually dark.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Undertomb is a dark room. East is a dead end. South is a dead end with printed name &quot;Collapsed Dead End&quot;. Northwest is a dead end called the Tortuous Alcove.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Undertomb is the candle lantern. It is lit.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As a result of this, three different rooms adjoin the Undertomb, all dead ends. This is much more concise than spelling them out one at a time would be.
<p>
<p>Inform often doesn't mind in what order it is told about the world, but it may need to know the name of a kind before that kind can be used. For example,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A coffer is a kind of container. In the Crypt is an open coffer.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>makes sense to Inform and results in the creation of a new thing, just called &quot;coffer&quot; in the absence of any other name to give it, whose kind is &quot;coffer&quot; and which is initially open. Whereas if Inform reads:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Crypt is an open coffer.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>without knowing that &quot;coffer&quot; is a kind, it simply makes a thing called &quot;open coffer&quot; (and which is not a container). Inform has to be careful like this: English is simply too overflowing with multiple meanings. An &quot;open railway ticket&quot;, for instance, is not a &quot;railway ticket&quot; that one can put objects into.
