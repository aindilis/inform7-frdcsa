<p>
<p>But when we test the previous section's example, we find that after a brief wait, the train pulls up: but it never goes away again. We have given instructions on how the scene ends, but not when it ends, and as a result the scene goes on forever once started.
<p>
<p>Even with simple story-lines, and this one could hardly be simpler, it is surprisingly easy to overlook something so that the whole story-line is derailed.
<p>
<p>The Scene index is intended to help with this. At the top is a chart showing all the scenes and how they are to begin, along with a key to the symbols used on it. One scene always included is &quot;Entire Game&quot;, a special scene which, as its name implies, is always being played out. But if we look at the Scene index for the previous example, we will also see our Train Stop scene, and find that it is marked with the red warning symbol for &quot;never ends&quot;. Let us fix this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Train Stop ends when the time since Train Stop began is 3 minutes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note the useful value &quot;time since Train Stop began&quot;:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>time since </b>(scene)<b> began</b> ... <i>time</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_scenetimesincebegan -->

<p>This phrase produces the time since the named scene began, which only makes sense, of course, if it has indeed begun. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">time since Entire Game began
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>time since </b>(scene)<b> ended</b> ... <i>time</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_scenetimesinceended -->

<p>This phrase produces the time since the named scene ended, which only makes sense, of course, if it has indeed ended. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">time since Formal Dinner ended
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>The actual times, in case they are needed, can be obtained with:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>time when </b>(scene)<b> began</b> ... <i>time</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_scenetimewhenbegan -->

<p>This phrase produces the time (i.e., the value of the &quot;time of day&quot; variable) at the moment when the given scene began.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->

<p><hr><img border=&quot;0&quot; src=images/testing.png id=&quot;testoval&quot; style=&quot;height:31px; width=40px&quot;>The testing command SCENES causes Inform to monitor the beginning and ending of scenes, and report on them. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>ask monk about lodging
<br>&quot;Welcome a poor traveler for the night?&quot; you ask, rubbing your fingers together to restore a little feeling.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The monk looks you up and down for a moment and you sense his reaction hanging in the balance; then he slaps you on the back, hard enough to drive the air from your lungs. &quot;In.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">[Scene 'Greeting' ends]
<br>The monk takes your elbow and pushes you imperiously toward dinner.
<br>[Scene 'Banquet' begins]
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>
<p>The following source is very short and simple, yet it already feels surprisingly interesting in play, because something is going on which the player does not control but must observe. The single scene both starts and finishes.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Age of Steam&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Station is a room. &quot;Eynforme Halt is a raised platform fringed with cowslip: a whistle-stop with no more than a signal and a water-tank.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Flying Scotsman is fixed in place. &quot;The Flying Scotsman, fastest train in the world, is now at a dead standstill.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Train Stop is a scene. Train Stop begins when the player is in the Station for the third turn. Train Stop ends when the time since Train Stop began is 3 minutes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Train Stop begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the Flying Scotsman to the Station;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The Flying Scotsman pulls up at the platform, to a billow of steam and hammering.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Train Stop ends:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the Flying Scotsman from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The Flying Scotsman inches away, with a squeal of released brakes, gathering speed invincibly until it disappears around the hill. All is abruptly still once more.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of entering the Flying Scotsman, say &quot;Alas, the [time when Train Stop began] arrival is only to take on water, not to set down or pick up.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;z / z / z / enter flying scotsman / z / z&quot;.
