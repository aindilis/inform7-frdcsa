<p>Stretching a point seasonally, we might write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn, say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This rule is nameless. It needs no name because it will never need to be referred to: by identifying it as an every turn rule we have already said enough to lodge it in the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook. In fact, though, it is easy to create a named rule:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the blossom shaking rule: say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The name of a rule must always end with the word &quot;rule&quot;, for clarity's sake. (The phrasing &quot;This is the ... rule&quot; is used because &quot;The ... rule&quot; would be open to misinterpretation.)
<p>
<p>Previously we had a rule which had no name, but belonged to a rulebook: now we have the opposite, because although the &quot;blossom shaking rule&quot; has a name, it has not been placed in any rulebook. That means it will probably never be applied, unless we give specific instructions for that.
<p>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible to both name and place a rule in a single sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn (this is the alternative blossom rule): say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now the &quot;alternative blossom rule&quot; is a named rule in the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook.
