Gases</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Inform normally assumes that everything is solid. It has no built-in support for gases or liquids, because they have so many different behaviours. For instance, is the important thing about gas that it diffuses, or that we breathe it, or that it mixes with other gases to react, or that it sometimes obscures vision? The answer depends on what we are trying to write, and for this reason Inform leaves it up to us.
<p>
<p>Gases are easier to deal with than liquids, because they tend to be everywhere in their location at once (unlike a liquid which might form a pool on the floor) and because they diffuse and mix by themselves (rather than being carried around or brought into contact with each other by the player). On the other hand, unlike liquids, gases are compressible: they can be present at low or high pressures, that is, in low or high concentrations.
<p>
<p>The simplest approach is the one in <b>Only You...</b>, where rooms are either filled with smoke or else smoke-free. Smoke gradually fills through the map, obscuring vision: no attempt is made to conserve the total quantity of smoke, as we assume that some fire is churning it out continuously to replace what diffuses away.
<p>
<p><b>Lethal Concentration 1</b> and <b>2</b> simulate a gas diffusing through a three-dimensional maze of rooms, and becoming dangerous above certain concentrations. There is just one possible gas, and it is modelled by giving each room a number which represents the concentration (in parts per million). This enables us to conserve the total amount of gas, or to have it released or captured by sources and sinks of given capacity.
<p>
<p>This could be extended by giving each room similar concentration levels for other gases, and providing for the diffusion rule to notice when different gases come into contact; or by giving a concentration (and also, for realism, a volume) to each closed container, applying rules for capturing and releasing gases as containers are opened and closed.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A concentration is a kind of value. 200.9ppm specifies concentration. 200.9 ppm specifies concentration.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A room has a concentration called current concentration. A room has a concentration called former concentration.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Probability inverse is a number that varies. [This is expressed as an inverse of the actual probability of diffusion from one room to another, to avoid error.] Probability inverse is 20. [That is, any given molecule of gas has a 5% chance of leaving by a given doorway at any given minute. Probability inverse should never drop below 10, the maximum number of exits from the room.]
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow the diffusion rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The diffusion rules are a rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A diffusion rule (this is the gas movement rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with space running through rooms:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let sum be 0.0 ppm;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with way running through directions:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let second space be the room way from the space;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if second space is a room:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let difference be the former concentration of the second space minus the former concentration of the space;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase sum by the difference;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let sum be sum divided by probability inverse;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now current concentration of the space is the former concentration of the space plus the sum.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>A technical note: it would be possible to write &quot;repeat with space running through rooms... repeat with second space running through rooms adjacent to the space&quot; instead, but in practice this loops through all the rooms * all the rooms again * all the directions (to determine adjacency). Phrasing the loop this way omits the second multiplier. For a map of 25 rooms, this means that the loop runs 25 times faster than it would otherwise, and of course for a larger map the effect would be even more dramatic.

<p>
<p>For variety of testing, here is another room set-up, this time with some corridors and walls within; uncommenting it, and commenting out the connected grid, will let us explore what would happen in alternative cases, to prove to ourselves that the model works consistently.

<p>
<p>For the sake at least of seeing what's going on in the example, let's also provide the player with the means to view the gas diffusion graphically:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The status grid is a device carried by the player. The status grid is switched on.

<p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The values set for these would depend on the type of poisonous gas in question; we'd want to adjust appropriately.
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say state of (space - a room):

<p>
<p>Now, in theory we might also want to account for sources and sinks, items that either inject poisonous gas into the environment or remove it again. For simplicity, we will assume that these contributions can also be calculated in ppm and that the total number of inert and poisonous gas molecules in a room never changes (so if poison gas molecules are added, an equal number of inert molecules are removed). If room pressure were able to change, our model would have to be improved, so let us assume for now that that never happens. We want this sink/source business to calculate before any other portion of the diffusion rulebook, so set it as a first diffusion rule.
