<p>Some commands and some objects raise special challenges when it comes to working out the player's intention.
<p>
<p>Sometimes this can be done with good rules about the assumptions Inform should make. <b>Alpaca Farm</b> demonstrates a USE command, always a challenge because USE can mean very different actions with different items.
<p>
<p>There are also times when we need to ask the player for more information. <b>Apples</b> demonstrates how sensibly to use properties to disambiguate between similar objects, while <b>Walls and Noses</b> rephrases the disambiguation question when special objects are involved: examining one of the walls of the room will make the game ask &quot;In which direction?&quot; and EXAMINE NOSE will lead to &quot;Whose nose do you mean, Frederica's, Betty's, Wilma's or your own?&quot;
<p>
<p>At other times, the player types something that is wrong in a predictable way: for instance, we might want to remove all the &quot;with...&quot; phrases from commands like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">HIT DOOR WITH FIST
<br>KICK DRAGON WITH FOOT
<br>LOOK WEST WITH EYES
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and merely parse the remainder of the command. (That last command may be unlikely, but novice players do quite often type commands that refer unnecessarily to body parts.) <b>Cave-troll</b> demonstrates how.
<p>
<p><b>WXPQ</b> demonstrates how to modify the error message the parser gives in response to a command it doesn't understand; this particular example focuses on the &quot;That noun doesn't make sense in this context&quot; message that arises from using the &quot;[any thing]&quot; or &quot;[any room]&quot; tokens, but the techniques could be adapted to handling other parser errors as well.
<p>
<p>For catching typing errors, Cedric Knight's extension Mistype may also be of use: it provides an automatic typo-correction function that the player can turn on or off.
