<p>When testing conditions, we normally talk only about specific things, or else ask if a particular circumstance happens:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the oaken door is open
<br>if a woman is carrying an animal
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But we can also use &quot;all&quot;, &quot;each&quot; or &quot;every&quot; to check the whole range:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if each door is open
<br>if anyone is carrying all of the animals
<br>if everybody is in the Dining Room
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform allows other English &quot;determiners&quot; (as they are sometimes called), as well:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if some of the doors are open
<br>if most of the doors are open
<br>if almost all of the doors are open
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>are true if at least one case is true, if a majority (any number greater than one half) or at least 80 per cent of the possible cases are true, respectively.
<p>
<p>And we can also use &quot;none&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. These three are all ways to say the same thing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if no door is open
<br>if all of the doors are not open
<br>if none of the doors is open
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>though it may be clearer style to find a positive way of putting things:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if all of the doors are closed
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>All, each and every can be applied to values, too - but only in some cases. For example, suppose we write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. A colour can be found or unfound.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And suppose that, during play, we assign the &quot;found&quot; property to any colour which the player notices on a wall. We might then want to write conditions like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if every colour is found
<br>if most of the colours are found
<br>if any colour is found
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But we always have to bear in mind that Inform might have no reasonable way to decide these questions. It will refuse to allow these, for example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if every number is positive
<br>if any text is palindromic
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(even supposing the adjective &quot;palindromic&quot; has been defined) - there are practically infinitely many possible numbers and texts, so the search cannot sensibly be done.
