<p>
<p>The command prompt is the text printed by Inform to ask the player for another command. Ordinarily this is simply a greater-than-sign, &quot;>&quot;, so we tend not to notice it as text at all. Internally, though, it is a variable value called &quot;command prompt&quot;, which means we can change it.
<p>
<p>For example, this will be a more conversational sort of prompt:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: now the command prompt is &quot;What now? &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Whereas this will be more up-to-the-minute and demanding:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: now the command prompt is &quot;[time of day] >&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(&quot;Time of day&quot; is another variable value, which is fairly self-explanatory, but will be covered in detail later on.) The prompt can be changed at any point, so can be used to indicate the current situation, or even as a sly way to introduce a sort of conversation between computer and player.

<a name="e283"><a href=doc123.html#e283 STYLE="text-decoration: none">***<b><b>Example</b> 113:  Don Pedro's Revenge</b></a><br>Combat scenario in which the player's footing and position changes from move to move, and the command prompt also changes to reflect that.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose our game features a detailed simulated combat between the player character and his opponent. He might have several weapons available, and several types of attack available; and at any given time he might be perched up in the rigging of his ship, standing on the open deck, or boxed in between some barrels. His options will vary depending on his position, and obviously it would detract from the pacing to make the player keep LOOKing in the middle of combat in order to remind himself where he is. Instead, we'll roll this information into the command prompt:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Don Pedro's Revenge&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Deck of the Helene Marie is a room. &quot;The two crews are embattled all around you, but your attention is reserved for your particular enemy: Don Pedro.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player is boxed;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;thrust&quot; or &quot;advance&quot; as advancing. Advancing is an action applying to nothing.

<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player is free;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You push forward aggressively, making your way to the open deck.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of jumping:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player is perched;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You leap and swing yourself boldly up into the rigging, leaving your attackers beneath you.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;advance / jump / advance / retreat / jump / retreat / retreat / advance&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Of course, this won't be much fun until we also provide the player with a few weapons, some more fighting maneuvers, and, most of all, a Don Pedro to defeat.
