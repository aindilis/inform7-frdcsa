<p>
<p>As we've seen, most relations have names - &quot;containment relation&quot;, for instance. These are themselves values in Inform, though there are a few restrictions on how they are used. (Relations can contain a colossal amount of data, so we don't want to have to copy them casually.)
<p>
<p>Consider these two examples:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Parity relates a number (called N) to a number (called M) when N minus M is even.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Joint magnitude relates a number (called N) to a number (called M) when N plus M is greater than 7.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here &quot;parity relation&quot; and &quot;joint magnitude relation&quot; are both values of the same kind: &quot;relation of numbers to numbers&quot;. In general, every relation is a value of kind &quot;relation of K to L&quot;, for the appropriate kinds K and L. So the parity relation doesn't have the same kind as the containment relation, for example. Because it often happens that K and L are the same, we can just say &quot;relation of K&quot; in this case, so we could equally say that the kind of the parity relation is &quot;relation of numbers&quot;.
<p>
<p>This is useful to know when writing phrases like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To chart (R - a relation of numbers):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with N running from 1 to 5:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with M running from 1 to 5:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if R relates N to M, say &quot;[N] &lt;=&gt; [M]   &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[line break]&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and now &quot;chart parity relation&quot; will work nicely, but &quot;chart visibility relation&quot; will be rejected (as it should be, because it relates things, not numbers). In general, if R is any relation, we can write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if R relates X to Y, ...
<br>now R relates X to Y;
<br>now R does not relate X to Y;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>to test, set and unset a relation R between two values. (Inform checks that the values X and Y have the right kind and produces a problem message if not.)
<p>
<p>Several useful adjectives can be applied to relations:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;empty&quot; - nothing relates to anything else
<br>&quot;symmetric&quot; - by definition X relates to Y if and only if Y relates to X
<br>&quot;equivalence&quot; - this is a relation &quot;in groups&quot;, or an &quot;equivalence relation&quot;
<br>&quot;one-to-one&quot; - it relates one K to one L
<br>&quot;one-to-various&quot; - similarly
<br>&quot;various-to-one&quot; - similarly
<br>&quot;various-to-various&quot; - similarly
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So for example it's possible to ask
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if R is a symmetric one-to-one relation of texts, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>With some relations, it's possible to clear them out by writing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now R is empty;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and with temporary relations (see the next section), it's even possible to change their valencies (one-to-one vs. one-to-various, etc.) using &quot;now&quot;, but only when they are empty. The exceptions where &quot;empty&quot; can't be used are those which can't be changed at all, like the parity relation above, and a few built-in cases such as the support, containment and incorporation relations, where emptying would dissolve the model world in a disastrous way.
