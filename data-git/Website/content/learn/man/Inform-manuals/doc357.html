<font><table><tr width="100%"><td width=80 valign="top"><a href=doc356.html border=0><img border=0 src=images/Back.png border=0></a><a href=index.html border=0><img border=0 src=images/Home.png border=0></a><a href=doc358.html border=0><img border=0 src=images/Forward.png border=0></a></td><td valign="top"><b>20.9.

<p>
<p>The length of a list can change as values are added or removed, and can in principle be any number from 0 upwards. A list with 0 entries is empty. We can find the length with:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>number of entries in</b>/of<b> </b>(list of values)<b></b> ... <i>number</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_numberentries -->

<p>This phrase produces the number of positions in the list. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the number of entries in {1, 1, 1, 3, 1}
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>is 5, even though there are only two genuinely different items in the list.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>If the length is N then the entries are numbered from 1 (the front) to N (the back). These entries can be accessed directly by their numbers. For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">entry 2 of L
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>refers to the second entry of L: it can be used as a value, or changed, just as if it were a named variable. For instance, we could write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now entry 7 of L is &quot;Spain&quot;;
<br>say &quot;The rain in [entry 7 of L] stays mainly in the plain.&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which would (untruthfully) print &quot;The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain&quot;, but only if L had an entry 7 to make use of: if L were a list of 5 entries, say, then a run-time problem results. (And if L cannot hold text, a problem message means that we never get as far as run-time.) Because entries number from 1, this is always incorrect:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">entry 0 of L
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and if L is currently empty, then there is no entry which can be accessed, so that any use of &quot;entry ... of L&quot; would produce a run-time problem. There are programming languages in the world where accessing entry 100 in a 7-entry list automatically extends it to be 100 entries long: Inform is not one of them. But see the next section for how to change list lengths explicitly.
