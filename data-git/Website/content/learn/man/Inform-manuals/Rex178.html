<p>Talking about characters presents some special challenges. For one thing, some characters are referred to by a proper name, but others are not: so the game might want to talk about &quot;Jack&quot; but also about &quot;the drunk pedestrian&quot;. In the absence of other information, Inform attempts to divine our intentions based on the words with which we defined a new character: but we can always override its guess with an explicit statement, such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Great Malefactor is proper-named.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p><b>Belfry</b> demonstrates further how titles are set at the start of play.
<p>
<p>The relation between the player and the other characters is not always static, however. Sometimes we want the player to learn a character's name part-way through play, and start referring to &quot;the drunk pedestrian&quot; as &quot;Fernando&quot;. Similarly, the status of another character may change due to some twist of the plot. <b>Gopher-wood</b> shows how to change the name of a character mid-game, and <b>Peers</b> handles changing the character's rank.
<p>
<p>Alternatively, of course, the player character may already know some of the other characters when the game begins, even if the player does not. In that case, we may want to add a tag-line or so of identification to a character's name when he first appears in the game. <b>A Humble Wayside Flower</b> shows one way of doing this.
<p>
<p>Another occasional challenge is dealing with such commands as EXAMINE DR. THISBY. The problem here is that Inform by default will understand the full stop after &quot;Dr&quot; to be the end of one command and the beginning of another, and will try to interpret &quot;Thisby&quot; as a verb. If we do have a game populated by such formally-addressed characters, we may turn to Punctuation Removal, which provides a phrase to remove the full stops in standard titles before attempting to interpret the command.
<p>
<p>Other characters have physical characteristics as well as names, of course, and <b>Meet Market</b> demonstrates one way of implementing people with notable features.
<p>
<p>Finally, in some IF, the roles of characters may change from playing to playing. If we are writing a replayable murder mystery, we might want to select a new culprit each time the game starts; for this, see <b>Clueless</b>.

<p>
<p>&quot;When play begins&quot; is the best point to initialize any aspects of the game that are meant to change between playings. For instance, in this scenario, we would randomly select one of the other characters to be guilty of murder:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Clueless&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The murderer is a person that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the murderer is a random person who is not the player.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Billiards Room is a room. Colonel Mustard and Professor Plum are men in the Billiards Room. Miss Scarlet and Mrs White are women in the Billiards Room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the murderer:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] certainly looks fiendish!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x mustard / x plum / x scarlet / x white&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
