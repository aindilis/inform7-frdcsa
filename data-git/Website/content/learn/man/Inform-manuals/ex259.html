<p><hr><img border=&quot;0&quot; src=images/beta.png id=&quot;betaoval&quot; style=&quot;height:31px; width=40px&quot;>This section and the previous one are about a feature which is being withdrawn from Inform in future. Experience shows there are equally good ways to achieve the same ends without needing procedural rules. As elegant as they were, they often confused users, and they were expensive at run-time (that is, they made everything work more slowly). Withdrawing them from Inform will make it possible to make more efficient story files, and will simplify the language.
<p>
<p>The &quot;ignore&quot; phrase is only one of a suite, <b>which should only be used in procedural rules</b>. The full list is:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #c00000; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>ignore </b>(rule)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_ignore_dep -->

<p>This phrase can only be used in procedural rules, which are now deprecated. It causes the named rule to be ignored (skipped over without producing a result) within the scope of the current &quot;follow&quot;.

<p>This phrase can only be used in procedural rules, which are now deprecated. Its only effect is to reverse the effect of any &quot;ignore&quot; phrase affecting the rule named.

<!-- definition of ph_reject_dep -->

<p>This phrase can only be used in procedural rules, which are now deprecated. It causes the named rule to used, but to have its result ignored, within the scope of the current &quot;follow&quot;. In other words, if the rule succeeds or fails then this is suppressed and its rulebook continues.

<!-- definition of ph_movebefore_dep -->

<p>This phrase can only be used in procedural rules, which are now deprecated. This causes the first rule to be ignored whenever it turns up in the ordinary way, but to be invoked either immediately before the second rule whenever that second rule is invoked. In effect, it cuts out the first rule from wherever it was, and glues it onto the second. Note that there is no obligation for the first rule to begin in the same rulebook(s) as the second, so this can be used to slot in a wholly new rule, perhaps only if certain circumstances hold.

<p>These rule-changing instructions allow apparently casual sentences to wreak havoc with the model world. This, for instance, is quite the recipe for mayhem and perplexity:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A procedural rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reject the result of the before rules;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignore the after rules;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the after rules to before the before rules.

<p>
<p>Observation of novice IF players suggests that they often have a hard time figuring out how to get started, especially if they are encountering the game in a context where they don't have time to settle in and read instructions. Here we provide some training wheels to help them learn to communicate.
<p>
<p>This is divided into several parts. The first part is the system of rules for general guidance, which could be excerpted and used anywhere. The second part is a scenario using these rules.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Solitude&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Part 1 - General Rules
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Have you played interactive fiction before? >&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now novice mode is whether or not the player consents.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The rationale for asking the question this way, and not another, is that novices asked whether they would like instructions very often say no, even if they need them.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Novice mode is a truth state that varies. Novice mode is true.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Stopping novice mode is an action out of world.
<br>Starting novice mode is an action out of world.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;novice mode off&quot; or &quot;novice off&quot; as stopping novice mode.
<br>Understand &quot;novice mode on&quot; or &quot;novice on&quot; as starting novice mode.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out stopping novice mode: now novice mode is false.
<br>Carry out starting novice mode: now novice mode is true.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report stopping novice mode: say &quot;Novice mode is now off.&quot;
<br>Report starting novice mode: say &quot;Novice mode is now on.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before reading a command when novice mode is true:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[line break]Some options to try:[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow the novice suggestion rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A novice suggestion rule (this is the suggestion that he put things on rule):

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A novice suggestion rule (this is the suggestion that he enter things rule):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player carries an edible relevant thing, say &quot;  [bold type]eat[roman type] [the list of edible relevant things carried by the player]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A novice suggestion rule (this is the suggestion that he wear things rule):

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Last novice suggestion rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[line break]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The suggestion about asking for help is no good unless we provide some. This might take any of a number of forms, but for the sake of example we'll use an easy way out:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short. Include Menus by Emily Short. Include Basic Help Menu by Emily Short.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After taking inventory when novice mode is true: say &quot;To get rid of any of these objects, [bold type]drop[roman type] it.&quot;
