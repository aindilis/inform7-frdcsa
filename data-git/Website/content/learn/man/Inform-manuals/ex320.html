<p>
<p>A few actions apply not to items alone, but also involve what might be called conversation. The first is the one used for looking things up in books (which is conversation of a kind, even if the author is not present): &quot;consulting ... about ...&quot;. For example,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Grove is a book of sybilline verses.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After consulting the book about &quot;grove&quot;, say &quot;The Grove is a sacred yadda, yadda. There's a tree, that sort of thing. Wisdom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After consulting the book about &quot;future events&quot;, say &quot;It's a bit, what's the word? Delphic.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that what follows &quot;about&quot; here is a piece of text in double-quotes, and not the name of something. It can be almost any text at all, and in fact we shall later see (in the chapter on &quot;Understanding&quot;) that we can match complicated patterns of words, too.
<p>
<p>Similar actions are used for conversing with people:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After asking the Sybil about &quot;verses&quot;, say &quot;She blushes.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After telling the Sybil about &quot;persians&quot;, say &quot;She nods gravely.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After answering the Sybil that &quot;I am mad&quot;, say &quot;She sighs.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These would be produced by commands like &quot;ask sybil about verses&quot;, &quot;tell sybil about persians&quot; and &quot;answer i am mad&quot;. Answering is very seldom used and can be forgotten about, but the distinction between asking and telling is often worth preserving, which is why there are two different actions for these. If you would prefer to make &quot;tell sybil about X&quot; do the same as &quot;ask sybil about X&quot;, the following rule would serve:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of telling the Sybil about something, try asking the Sybil about it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Games with a lot of conversation often involve great heaps of rules like the ones above, which can be repetitious to type out. We shall also later see (in the chapter on &quot;Tables&quot;) that we can tabulate questions and answers in a much more concise way, if we prefer.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Inform already understands YES, NO, and SORRY as commands in their own right, which can make things a little sticky when we want a character to ask a question of the player. The most important thing is not to cover some of the possible phrasings while ignoring others.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Replies&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Grove is a room. In the Grove is a woman called the Sybil.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking the Sybil to try saying no: try saying no. Instead of asking the Sybil to try saying yes: try saying yes. Instead of asking the Sybil to try saying sorry: try saying sorry.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of answering the Sybil that &quot;yes&quot;, try saying yes. Instead of answering the Sybil that &quot;no&quot;, try saying no. Instead of answering the Sybil that &quot;sorry&quot;, try saying sorry.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of saying yes in the presence of the Sybil:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;She looks interested.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of saying no in the presence of the Sybil:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;She looks annoyed.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of saying sorry in the presence of the Sybil:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;She looks bored.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The complexity arises from the fact that we want to handle both YES and SYBIL, YES. If we only had the latter, 'yes' would be treated as a text given to the Sybil, just as in the commands SAY YES TO SYBIL or ANSWER YES. But because we have defined it as a command (so that the player can use it independently), SYBIL, YES is understood as an order to the Sybil to do the YES action.
<p>
<p>Fortunately, we can redirect everything, as here, so that the results wind up the same.
<p>
<p>And if we want yet another variation not covered by the Inform standard:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;tell [someone] [text]&quot; as answering it that. Understand &quot;tell [someone] that [text]&quot; as answering it that.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But that is a matter for a later chapter.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;yes / sybil, yes / say yes to sybil / answer yes / tell sybil yes / no / sybil, no / say no to sybil / answer no / tell sybil no /  sorry / sybil, sorry / say sorry to sybil / answer sorry / tell sybil sorry&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
