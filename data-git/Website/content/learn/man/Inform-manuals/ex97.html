<p>
<p>Stretching a point seasonally, we might write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn, say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This rule is nameless. It needs no name because it will never need to be referred to: by identifying it as an every turn rule we have already said enough to lodge it in the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook. In fact, though, it is easy to create a named rule:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the blossom shaking rule: say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The name of a rule must always end with the word &quot;rule&quot;, for clarity's sake. (The phrasing &quot;This is the ... rule&quot; is used because &quot;The ... rule&quot; would be open to misinterpretation.)
<p>
<p>Previously we had a rule which had no name, but belonged to a rulebook: now we have the opposite, because although the &quot;blossom shaking rule&quot; has a name, it has not been placed in any rulebook. That means it will probably never be applied, unless we give specific instructions for that.
<p>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible to both name and place a rule in a single sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn (this is the alternative blossom rule): say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now the &quot;alternative blossom rule&quot; is a named rule in the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook.

<p>
<p>Names of rules can be listed in tables. This is convenient if, for instance, we decide that we'd like to swap the rules we use for a specific purpose, as in this continuation of our earlier example of automated description:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;The Crane's Leg, Grown Longer&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Material is a kind of value. The materials are wood, glass, stone, cloth, paper, clay, and metal. A thing has a material.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Color is a kind of value. The colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, black, brown, and white. A thing has a color. A thing is usually white.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A height is a kind of value. 3 feet 11 inches specifies a height. A thing has a height. Definition: a thing is tall if its height is 6 feet 0 inches or more. Definition: a thing is short if its height is 2 feet 0 inches or less.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Imitation relates various things to one thing (called the ideal). The verb to imitate (it imitates, they imitate, it is imitating) implies the imitation relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A table is a kind of supporter. A table is usually wood. The height of a table is usually 3 feet 8 inches. The ordinary table is a table. Every table imitates the ordinary table.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A rock is a kind of thing. A rock is usually stone. The ordinary rock is a rock. The height of a rock is usually 0 feet 3 inches. Every rock imitates the ordinary rock.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of a thing is usually &quot;[comparison with ideal][run paragraph on]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say comparison with ideal:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You observe [the noun]:[paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose row with character of the player in Table of Descriptive Reporting;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow instructions entry.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the comparative observation rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the sample be the ideal of the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the sample is not a thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Nothing special, really.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the material of the noun is not the material of the sample:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the height of the noun is not the height of the sample:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is shorter than the sample, say &quot;Unusually short at [height of the noun], and made of [material of the noun].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;Unusually tall at [height of the noun], and made of [material of the noun].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Distinct mostly in being made of [material of the noun].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the height of the noun is not the height of the sample:

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Pleasure Garden is a room. &quot;At the riverbank, a pleasing garden, having many curving paths and one straight.&quot;

<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;possess [any person]&quot; or &quot;be [any person]&quot; as possessing.
