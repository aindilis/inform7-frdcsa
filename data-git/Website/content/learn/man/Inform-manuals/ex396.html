Using new kinds of value in properties</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>It turns out to be very useful to create a new kind of value, and then create a property to hold it. So useful, in fact, that Inform provides two shortened forms for doing so. Here is the first, and the second (making &quot;conditions&quot;) is in the section following.
<p>
<p>Suppose we go back to our example of the candle lantern whose brightness we have to measure. It's clear that what we want to do is to define:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Brightness is a kind of value. The brightnesses are guttering, weak, radiant and blazing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now we can use the technique of the previous section:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The lantern has a brightness called the flame strength. The flame strength of the lantern is blazing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This works very nicely. The &quot;flame strength&quot; property is now only allowed to have one of four values we allowed: guttering light, weak light, radiant light or blazing light. So we have succeeded in recording our measurement.
<p>
<p>But it seems artificial to call the brightness of the lantern &quot;flame strength&quot;, when we could instead simply call it &quot;brightness&quot;. Much simpler to write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The lantern has a brightness. The lantern is blazing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now &quot;brightness&quot; is the name of both the property and the kind of value. What's particularly nice is that we can now use the names of the possible brightnesses - &quot;weak&quot;, &quot;blazing&quot; and so on - as adjectives. Inform knows that &quot;The lantern is blazing&quot; must be talking about the brightness property, because &quot;blazing&quot; is a brightness.
<p>
<p>Now we can improve our dead ends:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is a kind of room with printed name &quot;Dead End&quot; and description &quot;This is a dead end, where crags in the uneven rock are caught by the [brightness of the lantern] flame you hold aloft. Despite [river sound] there is no sign of the stream.&quot; A dead end is usually dark.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;[brightness of the lantern]&quot; is printed not as literal text, but as whatever the brightness currently is. (The square brackets mark it as what is called a text substitution, which will be the subject of the next chapter.) So we get something like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is a dead end, where crags in the uneven rock are caught by the blazing flame you hold aloft. Despite a faint whispering of running water there is no sign of the stream.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So now we have a lantern, which has a brightness as a property. But we can build on this further if we like. A brightness such as &quot;guttering&quot; is a value, so it can have properties in its own right. That can be quite useful, in fact:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A brightness can be adequate or inadequate. A brightness is usually adequate. Guttering is inadequate.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is convenient because it divides up the brightnesses:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a book. The description of the book is &quot;[if the brightness of the lantern is adequate]Many secrets are now yours.[otherwise]No, the print's too tiny by this awful light.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And while we're at it, let's give each brightness its own corresponding temperature:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Temperature is a kind of value. 100C specifies a temperature.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A brightness has a temperature. The temperature of a brightness is usually 700C. The temperature of blazing is 1400C. The temperature of radiant is 1100C.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the lantern is &quot;The lantern shines with a flame at [temperature of the brightness of the lantern].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Candle flames are hotter than most people think.)
