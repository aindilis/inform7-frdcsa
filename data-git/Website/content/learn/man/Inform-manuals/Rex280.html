<p>Writing on something is only one way a player can change its visual appearance. IF authors have long been wary of paint brushes, because a sufficiently motivated player could go through a whole landscape like a graffiti artist with a railway bridge. We want to give the player the illusion of freedom of action, while avoiding a situation where unlimited numbers of different decorations might be needed - that would need a table of potentially unlimited size.
<p>
<p>One approach is to limit the number of items which can be decorated. In <b>Palette</b>, only the canvas can be painted, and each image overlays the last. <b>Early Childhood</b> increases the range to allow a whole kind (&quot;block&quot;) to be painted, and also shows how the changing colours can be used to distinguish between otherwise identical objects.
<p>
<p><b>Brown</b> finds a different way to limit the number of simultaneous decorations: almost anything can have a red sticky label attached, but there is only one red sticky label. (So to decorate a new item, the player must first un-decorate an old one.)

<p>There are hundreds of traditional pigments, from lampblack to burnt sienna, so we will confine ourselves to just two:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Palette&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Atelier is a room. &quot;The floridly untidy loft space used by a moderately unsuccessful artist (you, that is).&quot; The canvas, palette and paint brush are here. Understand &quot;painting&quot; as the canvas.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are white, red, blue and green.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The canvas has a colour. The canvas is white. The printed name of the canvas is &quot;largely [colour] canvas&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Painting is an action applying to one thing and one colour. Check painting: if the noun is not the canvas, say &quot;Centuries of tradition suggest that canvas is the natural home of paint.&quot; instead. Carry out painting: now the colour of the canvas is the colour understood. Report painting: say &quot;You splash away at the now [canvas].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;paint [something] [a colour]&quot; as painting.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;calico&quot; as white. Understand &quot;cerulean&quot; or &quot;cerulean blue&quot; as blue.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;examine canvas / paint canvas red / examine canvas / paint canvas cerulean / examine canvas&quot;.
