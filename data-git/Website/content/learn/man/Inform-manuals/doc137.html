<p>It is very often useful to know how many things are in a given situation, and for this purpose we have the &quot;number of ...&quot; construction. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the number of edible things carried
<br>the number of things on the table
<br>the number of people in the Dining Room
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Whereas &quot;a woman is holding an animal&quot; makes the same test as &quot;an animal is held by a woman&quot;, getting the same result, counting is not so even-handed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the number of women holding animals
<br>the number of animals held by women
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>are different questions and, unless the ration is strictly one lapdog per baroness, will have different answers. If Cruella de Vil has 101 dalmatians, they may be very different indeed.
<p>
<p>It can also be helpful to count things with no particular location, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the number of rooms
<br>the number of closed doors
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins, change the right hand status line to &quot;Explored: [number of visited rooms]/[number of rooms]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Provided that the possible range is finite, we can also use &quot;number of&quot; to count values which match a description. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the number of non-recurring scenes
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>or if we were to define
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then &quot;the number of colours&quot; would evaluate to 7. As with other ways of talking about whole ranges of values, this only works if the range is manageable. &quot;The number of numbers&quot; cannot sensibly be worked out: there are infinitely many, for all practical purposes, and similarly for &quot;the number of texts&quot;.
