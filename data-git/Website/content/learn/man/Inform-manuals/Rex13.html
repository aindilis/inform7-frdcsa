<p>
<p>Some commands and some objects raise special challenges when it comes to working out the player's intention.
<p>
<p>Sometimes this can be done with good rules about the assumptions Inform should make. <b>Alpaca Farm</b> demonstrates a USE command, always a challenge because USE can mean very different actions with different items.
<p>
<p>There are also times when we need to ask the player for more information. <b>Apples</b> demonstrates how sensibly to use properties to disambiguate between similar objects, while <b>Walls and Noses</b> rephrases the disambiguation question when special objects are involved: examining one of the walls of the room will make the game ask &quot;In which direction?&quot; and EXAMINE NOSE will lead to &quot;Whose nose do you mean, Frederica's, Betty's, Wilma's or your own?&quot;
<p>
<p>At other times, the player types something that is wrong in a predictable way: for instance, we might want to remove all the &quot;with...&quot; phrases from commands like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">HIT DOOR WITH FIST
<br>KICK DRAGON WITH FOOT
<br>LOOK WEST WITH EYES
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and merely parse the remainder of the command. (That last command may be unlikely, but novice players do quite often type commands that refer unnecessarily to body parts.) <b>Cave-troll</b> demonstrates how.
<p>
<p><b>WXPQ</b> demonstrates how to modify the error message the parser gives in response to a command it doesn't understand; this particular example focuses on the &quot;That noun doesn't make sense in this context&quot; message that arises from using the &quot;[any thing]&quot; or &quot;[any room]&quot; tokens, but the techniques could be adapted to handling other parser errors as well.
<p>
<p>For catching typing errors, Cedric Knight's extension Mistype may also be of use: it provides an automatic typo-correction function that the player can turn on or off.

<a name="e13"><a href=Rdoc45.html#e13 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 354:  Apples</b></a><br>Prompting the player on how to disambiguate otherwise similar objects.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Inform by default detects whether two objects can be disambiguated by any vocabulary available to the player. If so, it asks a question; if not, it picks one of the identical objects at random.
<p>
<p>Generally this produces good behavior. Occasionally, though, two objects have some distinguishing characteristic that doesn't appear in the object name. For instance, suppose we've created a class of apples that can be told apart depending on whether they've been bitten or not:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An apple is a kind of thing. Consumption is a kind of value. The consumptions are pristine and bitten. An apple has a consumption. The description of an apple is &quot;It is [consumption].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the consumption property as describing an apple.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The player can meaningfully type
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>EAT BITTEN APPLE
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>or
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>EAT PRISTINE APPLE
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but if he types
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>EAT APPLE
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform will, annoyingly, ask
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Which do you mean, an apple or the apple?
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This gives the player no indication of why Inform is making a distinction. So here we add a special &quot;printing the name&quot; rule to get around that situation:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;Apples&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Orchard is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An apple is a kind of thing. Consumption is a kind of value. The consumptions are pristine and bitten. An apple has a consumption. The description of an apple is &quot;It is [consumption].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the consumption property as describing an apple.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before printing the name of an apple while asking which do you mean: say &quot;[consumption] &quot;. Before printing the plural name of an apple while asking which do you mean: say &quot;[consumption] &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries three apples.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of eating a pristine apple:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You take a satisfying bite.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun is bitten.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of eating a bitten apple:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You consume the apple entirely.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the noun from play.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform will also separate the bitten from the pristine apples in inventory listings and room descriptions, even though it's not clear why; we can improve on that behavior thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before listing contents: group apples together.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for grouping together an apple (called target):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let source be the holder of the target;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[number of apples held by the source in words] apple[s], some bitten&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before printing the plural name of an apple (called target):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let source be the holder of the target;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if every apple held by the source is bitten, say &quot;bitten &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if every apple held by the source is pristine, say &quot;pristine &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;i / eat apple / i / eat apple / pristine / i / eat apple / pristine / i&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
