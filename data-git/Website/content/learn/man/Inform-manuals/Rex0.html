<p>
<p>Crowds of characters introduce new challenges, because we often want to show them interacting with one another, or to describe individuals in less detail when a whole group is present.
<p>
<p><b>Strictly Ballroom</b> gives us a set of characters who pair off each turn, making sure to mention each one once, and leaving one unfortunate person behind as a wallflower: this exemplifies how we might use a behavioral rule not to dictate the behavior of each individual separately but rather to model a whole group together. <b>Happy Hour</b> does calculate movements for characters individually, but then collates the descriptions, creating a single paragraph to describe whatever group is currently in the room.
<p>
<p>Characters can also have complicated attitudes to one another, and it can be helpful to use relations to track these. <b>Unthinkable Alliances</b> demonstrates the grouping of characters into alliance factions, while <b>The Abolition of Love</b> provides a host of relations to track love affairs, marriages, memberships in families, and mere mutual respect.
<p>
<p><b>Emma</b> combines these two effects: its characters move between social groups depending on how they feel about the others in their particular talking circle, and descriptions change depending on who is where in the room.
<p>
<p><b>Lugubrious Pete's Delicatessen</b> simulates a queue at a deli, in which the customers who most impress Pete get served first.

<p>
<p>Suppose we are modeling a complex society seething with interpersonal relations of every kind.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;The Abolition of Love&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 1 - Relation types
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Loving relates one person to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Noticing relates various people to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Impressing relates one person to various people.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Fancying relates various people to various people.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Acquaintance relates people to each other.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Marriage relates one person to another.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Alliance relates people to each other in groups.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Chapel is a room. Elizabeth, Wickham and Darcy are people in the Chapel. Mr Bennett and Mrs Bennett are people in the Chapel. Georgiana is a person in the Chapel.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to love (he loves, they love, he loved, he is loved) implies the loving relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to notice (he notices, they notice, he noticed, he is noticed) implies the noticing relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to impress (he impresses, they impress, he impressed, he is impressed) implies the impressing relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to fancy (he fancies, they fancy, he fancied, he is fancied) implies the fancying relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to know (he knows, they know, he knew, he is known) implies the acquaintance relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to be married to implies the marriage relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to be related to implies the alliance relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Elizabeth loves Darcy. Elizabeth fancies Darcy. Elizabeth notices Darcy. Elizabeth impresses Darcy.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Bennett is related to Mrs Bennett and Elizabeth. Mr Bennett is married to Mrs Bennett.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Georgiana is related to Darcy.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we want ways to set and unset all of these relations. (In the interests of thoroughness, we may get a bit far-fetched here. It is not recommended in practice that we make the player guess the verb &quot;traduce&quot;.)
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 2 - Setting and Unsetting Love (1-1)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;infatuate [someone] with [someone]&quot; as infatuating it with. Infatuating it with is an action applying to two visible things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out infatuating it with:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun loves the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report infatuating it with:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Now [the noun] loves [a random person loved by the noun][if the second noun loves someone], while [the second noun] loves [a random person loved by the second noun][end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;embitter [someone] toward [someone]&quot; as embittering it toward. Embittering it toward is an action applying to two visible things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out embittering it toward:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun does not love the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report embittering it toward:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] sees [the second noun] in a different light and no longer feels any affection.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Because love is a 1-1 relation, a person cannot love more than one other character at a time. Whenever we set a character to love a new person, that person ceases to love the character loved before. It is a fickle world.
<p>
<p>One to various relations are a bit more open: we can say someone impresses multiple other characters, and our additions to the list do not override the initial ones.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 3 - Setting and Unsetting Impressed (1-V)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;commend [someone] to [someone]&quot; as commending it to. Commending it to is an action applying to two visible things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out commending it to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun impresses the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report commending it to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The second noun] takes a very decided interest in [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;traduce [someone] to [someone]&quot; as traducing it to. Traducing it to is an action applying to two visible things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out traducing it to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun does not impress the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report traducing it to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The second noun], hearing your story, decides not to be at all impressed with [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And because this is a one-to-various relation, we can also make statements which set multiple relations at once, so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;celebrate [someone]&quot; as celebrating. Celebrating is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out celebrating:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun impresses every person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report celebrating:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The list of people who are impressed by the noun] take a very decided interest in [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;slander [someone]&quot; as slandering to. Slandering to is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out slandering to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every person is not impressed by the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report slandering to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Now [the noun] impresses [the list of people who are impressed by the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that the above unsetting is not equivalent to &quot;now the noun does not impress every person&quot; -- which would be ambiguous in spoken English, as well. Various-to-one relations are similar:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 4 - Setting and Unsetting Noticing (V-1)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;draw the attention of [someone] to [someone]&quot; as drawing the attention of it to. Drawing the attention of it to is an action applying to two visible things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out drawing the attention of it to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun notices the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report drawing the attention of it to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] glances thoughtfully in the direction of [the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;distract [someone] from [someone]&quot; as distracting it from. Distracting it from is an action applying to two visible things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out distracting it from:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun does not notice the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report distracting it from:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You distract [the noun] from [the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;draw attention to [someone]&quot; as drawing attention to. Drawing attention to is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out drawing attention to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every person notices the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report drawing attention to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You quickly cause everyone to attend to [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;outshine [someone]&quot; as outshining. Outshining is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out outshining:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every person does not notice the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report outshining:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You quickly distract everyone from [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 5 - Setting and Unsetting Fancying (V-V)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;flatter [someone]&quot; as flattering. Flattering is an action applying to one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out flattering:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every person fancies the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report flattering:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You draw down universal admiration for [the noun] by casting him or her in a flattering light.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;unflatter [someone]&quot; as unflattering. [Okay, okay, but it's four am.] Unflattering is an action applying to one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out unflattering:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every person does not fancy the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report unflattering:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] gives everyone a universal disgust.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;admire [someone]&quot; as admiring. Admiring is an action applying to one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out admiring: now the player fancies the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report admiring: say &quot;You find you rather fancy [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;loathe [someone]&quot; as loathing. Loathing is an action applying to one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out loathing: now the player does not fancy the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report loathing: say &quot;You take [the noun] in disgust.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;cause chaos&quot; as causing chaos. Causing chaos is an action applying to nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out causing chaos:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every person fancies every person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report causing chaos: say &quot;Now everyone fancies everyone else, which is quite an inconvenient state of affairs.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;relieve chaos&quot; as relieving chaos. Relieving chaos is an action applying to nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out relieving chaos:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every person is fancied by no one.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report relieving chaos: say &quot;Now no one fancies anyone, which is safe but tedious.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Our options for setting and unsetting symmetrical relations are more limited again:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 6 - Setting and Unsetting Marriage (1-1 Symmetrical)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;marry [someone] to [someone]&quot; as uniting it in matrimony with. Uniting it in matrimony with is an action applying to two visible things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out uniting it in matrimony with:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun is married to the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report uniting it in matrimony with:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You perform the marriage of [the noun] to [the second noun], joining them to the family of [a list of people related to the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;divorce [someone] from [someone]&quot; as divorcing it from. Divorcing it from is an action applying to two visible things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check divorcing it from:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is not married to the second noun, say &quot;[The noun] is not married to [the second noun] anyway.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out divorcing it from:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun is not married to the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report divorcing it from:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] is now not married to [the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>When we unset the symmetrical relation on one side, it is automatically set or unset on the other. It is not necessary to say &quot;the second noun is married to the noun&quot; or &quot;the second noun is not married to the noun&quot;, even though that is the case.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 7 - Setting and Unsetting Acquaintance (V-V Symmetrical)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;introduce [someone] to [someone]&quot; as introducing it to. Introducing it to is an action applying to two visible things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out introducing it to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun knows the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report introducing it to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You introduce [the noun] to [the second noun]. Now [the noun] is acquainted with [the list of people who are known by the noun], and [the second noun] is acquainted with [the list of people who are known by the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;announce [someone]&quot; as announcing. Announcing is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out announcing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every person knows the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report announcing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You announce [the noun] to the whole assembled company.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;ostracise [someone]&quot; as ostracising. Ostracising is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out ostracising:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every person does not know the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report ostracising:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You cause everyone present to forget and pretend not to be acquainted at all with [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And finally, setting groups:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 8 - Setting and Unsetting Familial Relations (Groups)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;make [someone] adopt [someone]&quot; as forcing it to adopt. Forcing it to adopt is an action applying to two visible things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out forcing it to adopt:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun is related to the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report forcing it to adopt:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Now [the second noun] is related to [the list of people related to the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;make [someone] disown [someone]&quot; as forcing it to disown. Forcing it to disown is an action applying to two visible things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out forcing it to disown:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the second noun is not related to the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report forcing it to disown:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Now [the second noun] is related to [the list of people who are related to the second noun], and [the noun] is related to [the list of people who are related to the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Notice that when we say &quot;the second noun is not related&quot;, we remove that person from the group: they are now in a separate group of their own, while the rest of the group's members remain related to one another.
<p>
<p>And finally, a long litany of test cases, complete with the relations lists:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test acquaintance with &quot;relations / introduce darcy to elizabeth / introduce darcy to wickham / announce mr bennett / relations / ostracise wickham / introduce georgiana to wickham / relations&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test impression with &quot;commend georgiana to elizabeth / relations / celebrate Mrs bennett / relations / traduce mrs bennett to darcy / relations / slander mrs bennett / relations&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test notice with &quot;draw the attention of darcy to elizabeth / relations / draw attention to mr bennett / relations / distract darcy from mr bennett / relations / outshine mr bennett / relations&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test love with &quot;embitter elizabeth toward darcy / relations / infatuate elizabeth with wickham / relations&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test marriage with &quot;marry elizabeth to darcy / relations / divorce elizabeth from darcy / relations&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test alliance with &quot;make mr bennett adopt georgiana / relations / make mrs bennett disown georgiana / relations&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test fancying with &quot;admire elizabeth / relations / loathe elizabeth / relations / flatter elizabeth / relations / unflatter elizabeth / relations / cause chaos / relations / relieve chaos / relations&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;test acquaintance / test impression / test notice / test love / test alliance / test fancying / test marriage&quot;.
