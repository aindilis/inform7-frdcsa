<p>Lastly, if we define an adjective in this calibrating way, we also automatically benefit from the use of the superlative form. That is, if we define
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: A container is large if its carrying capacity is 10 or more.
<br>Definition: A container is small if its carrying capacity is 5 or less.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then we can talk about things like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the largest container
<br>the smallest open container
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Though we should be careful, in the second case, because we might get nothing: maybe all the containers are closed at the moment this is used. And in general there might be several equally large largest containers, in which case we should not rely on getting any particular one of those rather than another.
<p>
<p>Note that Inform constructs comparatives and superlatives by a pretty simplistic system. If we want to use these forms for an adjective expressing the relatively large size of a room, we had better go with &quot;roomy&quot; (roomier, roomiest) - not &quot;spacious&quot; (spaciouser, spaciousest).
