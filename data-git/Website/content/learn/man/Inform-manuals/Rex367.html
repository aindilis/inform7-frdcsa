<p>Under ordinary circumstances, Inform does not keep track of the player's posture, nor of his exact location in a room. <b>Lies</b> implements a room in which the player can lie in different positions on the floor, getting different views as a result.
<p>
<p>Our other examples are all modifications of the way Inform handles player movement to make better default guesses at what he wants to do: <b>Anchorite</b> adds a GET DOWN and DOWN command that work when the player is on a supporter, to accompany GET UP, GET OFF, and GET OUT (already understood). <b>Hagia Sophia</b> makes the player rise before heading in a compass direction, but only if movement in that direction is actually possible. And <b>Get Axe</b> makes the player get out of a portable container before attempting to lift it - a consideration that comes up relatively rarely, but that might pertain to inflatable rafts, beanbag chairs, and other lightweight but capacious pieces of furniture.

<p>We could now re-write the check rules so that any time someone (the player or someone else) tries to pick up a container which he is in, he will first get out:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;GET AXE&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the clever can't take what you're inside rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the person asked is in the noun, try the person asked exiting;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the person asked is in the noun, rule fails.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The clever can't take what you're inside rule is listed instead of the can't take what you're inside rule in the check taking rules.
