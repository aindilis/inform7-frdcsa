<p>
<p>There are times when even the commands ASK and TELL are overkill: sometimes the player doesn't have much information to offer, so TELL is never useful, for instance. If we don't want to make any distinction between modes of conversation, we can conflate the actions so that ASK LUCIUS ABOUT OLLIVANDER, TELL LUCIUS ABOUT OLLIVANDER and LUCIUS, OLLIVANDER all do the same thing: see <b>Sybil 1</b>.
<p>
<p>If we are frequently permitting the player to say things like LUCIUS, OLLIVANDER as shorthand for &quot;talk to Lucius about Ollivander&quot;, then we may also want to allow LUCIUS, OLLIVANDER? This makes the player character seem a bit slow (or at least Laconic), but it is an effective interface in some cases. The trick is that the question mark at the end of the command may prevent Inform from recognizing the keyword; should that problem arise, we may want to use Punctuation Removal to erase question marks from the player's command before attempting to interpret it.
<p>
<p>Along the same lines, there are situations in conversation where similar commands do not correspond to the same actions within Inform; if we're careless about this, we may force the player to guess which vocabulary we want him to use, which is always vexing. Some cases to look out for:
<p>
<p>Inform has actions for &quot;saying yes&quot; and &quot;saying no&quot;. Sometimes this is useful, but sometimes we want YES and SAY YES TO FRED to do the same thing. <b>Sybil 2</b> shows how to roll these responses into one; <b>Proposal</b> expands on the idea to show more ways in which a player could reasonably answer a question put by another character.
<p>
<p>Again, if we want ASK SYBIL ABOUT CAKE to do the same thing as SHOW CAKE TO SYBIL, we might use the technique in <b>Nameless</b> to make objects into valid topics of conversation, and to make ASK and SHOW behave the same way.

<p>
<p>Sometimes we do not particularly want to deal with all the variations on asking, telling, or answering someone something, but want to direct everything to a single conversational command:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Consulting the Oracle&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Grove is a room. In the Grove is a woman called the Sybil.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of telling someone about something, try asking the noun about it. Instead of answering the noun that something, try asking the noun about it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking the Sybil about &quot;persians&quot;, say &quot;She nods gravely.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And similarly, a difference between GIVE and SHOW is sometimes overkill:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of showing something to someone, try giving the noun to the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a coin. Instead of giving the coin to the Sybil: move the coin to the Sybil; say &quot;She accepts with a smile.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>It is also often the case that we want to accept more than one form of a term. For instance
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking the Sybil about &quot;Darius/king&quot;, say &quot;Her smile unnerves you.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will match either &quot;Darius&quot; or &quot;king&quot;. If necessary, we can go a step further and define our own token to match a variety of phrases, like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;Athenians/Spartans/Greeks&quot; or &quot;hoplite army/forces&quot; as &quot;[Greeks]&quot;. Instead of asking the Sybil about &quot;[Greeks]&quot;, say &quot;She looks encouraging.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The token &quot;[Greeks]&quot; will match all of &quot;Athenians&quot;, &quot;Spartans&quot;, &quot;Greeks&quot;, &quot;hoplite army&quot;, or &quot;hoplite forces&quot;. It will not match &quot;hoplite&quot; or &quot;forces&quot; alone; it is important to note that the / divides individual words which are understood equivalently, but does not define entire phrases as equivalent. More about how Inform understands specific phrases can be found in the chapter on Understanding.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;test one / test two&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test one with &quot;ask sybil about persians / tell sybil about persians / sybil, persians / ask sybil about darius / ask sybil about king&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test two with &quot;ask sybil about greeks / ask sybil about athenians / ask sybil about hoplite army / ask sybil about hoplite forces / give the coin to the sybil&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
