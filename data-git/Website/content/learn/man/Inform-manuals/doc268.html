<p>
<p>In many cases, if K is the name of a kind of value, then Inform automatically makes an Understand token called &quot;[K]&quot; which matches only values of K. An example is &quot;[number]&quot;, which matches text like 203 or SEVEN. There is a chart of the kinds of value in the Kinds index for a project, showing which ones can be understood in this way.
<p>
<p>In particular, any newly created kind of value can always be understood. We make good use of that in the example game &quot;Studious&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Studious&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Studio is a room. &quot;The unreal world of the photographic studio, full of fake furniture, cantilevered stands and silver-white shades like miniature parachutes.&quot; The lumpy black camera is in the Studio. &quot;A lumpy black camera hangs from a tripod.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The rake-thin model is a woman in the Studio. &quot;A rake-thin model, exquisitely bored and boringly exquisite, angles herself indolently.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Limb is a kind of value. The limbs are left leg, left arm, right leg and right arm.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Detailing is an action applying to one limb and one visible thing, requiring light. Check detailing: if the camera is not carried then say &quot;You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?&quot; instead. Report detailing: say &quot;Click! You take a detail photograph of the [limb understood] of [the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;photograph [limb] of [a person]&quot; as detailing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;get camera / photograph left leg of model&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note the way we can refer to the limb mentioned by the player as the &quot;limb understood&quot;. Similarly, we could talk about the &quot;number understood&quot; if the value parsed had been a number, and so on.
<p>
<p>One of the built-in kinds of value is worth special note: time. A time can hold either a specific time of day, such as 10:23 PM, or a duration of something, such as 21 minutes. The &quot;[a time]&quot; token matches times of day, such as 10:15 AM or MIDNIGHT. But 10 MINUTES wouldn't be recognised by &quot;[a time]&quot; since it isn't a specific moment in the day. To get around this, an alternative version called &quot;[a time period]&quot; is available. So:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;wait for [a time period]&quot; as ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>would match WAIT FOR AN HOUR or WAIT FOR TWO HOURS 12 MINUTES.
