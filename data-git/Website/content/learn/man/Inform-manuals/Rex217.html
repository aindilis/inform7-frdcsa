<p>
<p>Inform's division of geography into &quot;rooms&quot; is a good compromise for most purposes. The rooms are cut off from each other by (imaginary or actual) walls, while all of the interior of a given room is regarded as the same place.
<p>
<p>Suppose we want to blur the boundaries between rooms, in an environment where there are no walls: out of doors, for instance?
<p>
<p>The simplest cases involve making something exceptional visible in more than one place. <b>Carnivale</b> features an exceptionally large landmark seen by day; <b>Eddystone</b> an exceptionally bright one by night. <b>Waterworld</b> allows a very distant object (the Sun) to be seen throughout many rooms, but never approached. <b>View of Green Hills</b> gives the player an explicit command for looking through into an adjacent room.
<p>
<p>Three systematic examples then present outdoor landscapes with increasing sophistication. <b>Tiny Garden</b> gives the multiple rooms of an extended lawn descriptions which automatically adapt to say which directions lead into further lawn area. <b>Rock Garden</b> provides a relation, &quot;connected with&quot;, between rooms, allowing items in one to be seen from the other: an attempt to interact with a visible item in a different area of the garden triggers an implicit going action first. <b>Stately Gardens</b> provides a much larger outdoor area, where larger landmarks are visible from further away, and room descriptions are highly adaptive.
<p>
<p>In an outdoor environment, the distinction between a one-move journey and a multiple-move journey is also blurred. <b>Hotel Stechelberg</b> shows a signpost which treats these equally.

<a name="e217"><a href=Rdoc11.html#e217 STYLE="text-decoration: none">**<b><b>Example</b> 62:  Tiny Garden</b></a><br>A lawn made up of several rooms, with part of the description written automatically.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Sometimes we want to make a list of something too complicated to express in a say list... phrase. When this happens, we can instead mark all the items we want to mention as &quot;marked for listing&quot;.
<p>
<p>In this case, we have a lawn area made up of four rooms. We want each room to automatically describe the directions leading to the other parts of the lawn. To do this, we will first determine which directions are relevant and mark those for listing, then list them.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Tiny Garden&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Herb Garden is a room. &quot;Along this side of the house run your great-aunt's herb beds.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A Grassy Room is a kind of room. The printed name of a Grassy Room is usually &quot;Lawn&quot;. The description of a Grassy Room is &quot;The grass underfoot is thick and green. The lawn extends to [grassy directions] from here.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The following phrase goes through all the directions in the compass and marks the ones that are interesting to us at the moment. We will learn more about &quot;the room (some direction) from...&quot; in Chapter 5, and repeating in Chapter 10.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say grassy directions:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with that way running through directions:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the room that way from the location is a grassy room,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now that way is marked for listing;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[a list of directions which are marked for listing]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every direction is not marked for listing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Lawn1 is west of the Herb Garden. It contains a picnic table and a wicker basket. Lawn2 is south of Lawn1 and southeast of Lawn4. Lawn3 is southwest of Lawn1, west of Lawn2, and south of Lawn4. Lawn4 is west of Lawn1. Lawn4 contains a birdbath. The birdbath is fixed in place.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Lawn1, Lawn2, Lawn3, and Lawn4 are Grassy Rooms.
