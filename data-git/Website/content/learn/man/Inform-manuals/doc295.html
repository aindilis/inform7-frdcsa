<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> Only while listing contents, and only when a collection of items to be grouped together is reached. This in turn happens only if a &quot;before listing contents&quot; rule has chosen it (see previous section). The first item in the group is the one to which the activity formally applies. The variable &quot;listing group size&quot; gives the number of items grouped together in this way.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> The items grouped together are printed in an English phrase, such as &quot;egg, chicken and farmer&quot;. In particular, they are not split onto separate lines even if the rest of the list is. (See previous section.)
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) Here are Scrabble pieces which are described as &quot;the tile W from a Scrabble set&quot; or similar outside of lists, but which, when they turn up together in lists, are rolled together into &quot;the tiles A, B and D from a Scrabble set&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A Scrabble piece is a kind of thing. The X, the Y and the Z are Scrabble pieces.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before listing contents: group Scrabble pieces together.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before printing the name of a Scrabble piece while not grouping together, say &quot;tile &quot;. After printing the name of a Scrabble piece while not grouping together, say &quot; from a Scrabble set&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before grouping together Scrabble pieces, say &quot;the tiles &quot;. After grouping together Scrabble pieces, say &quot; from a Scrabble set&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(b) Maybe we only want an abbreviated form when there are five or more tiles in one place:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A Scrabble piece is a kind of thing. The X, the W, the F, the Y and the Z are Scrabble pieces in the Lounge.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before listing contents: group Scrabble pieces together.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before grouping together Scrabble pieces when the listing group size is greater than 4:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;some [listing group size in words] tiles (&quot;.
<br>After grouping together Scrabble pieces when the listing group size is greater than 4:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;) from a Scrabble set&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(c) We can throw out all pretence at listing and say whatever we like, in fact:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before listing contents while taking inventory: group utensils together. Rule for grouping together utensils: say &quot;the usual utensils&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
