<p>
<p>Like figures and sounds, files must be declared before they can be used. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The File of Glaciers is called &quot;ice&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This creates a new named constant &quot;File of Glaciers&quot; to refer to the file, throughout the source text. We use this name for it whether or not the actual disc file exists yet: it might be one that will only be created if something unusual happens in play, for instance.
<p>
<p>Quoted filenames should contain only letters and digits, should be 23 characters or fewer, and should begin with a letter. (In particular they can contain no slashes or dots - no subfolders or extensions can be indicated.) The actual filename this translates to will vary from platform to platform, but &quot;ice.glkdata&quot; is typical, stored in some sensible folder.
<p>
<p>Every file has an owner - not a person, but the project which normally writes to it. Inform assumes that the current project will be owning any file which it declares - the File of Glaciers, for instance. But we can optionally specify that it is owned by somebody else:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The file of Boundaries (owned by another project) is called &quot;milnor&quot;.
<br>The file of Spectral Sequences (owned by project &quot;4122DDA8-A153-46BC-8F57-42220F9D8795&quot;) is called &quot;adams&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform uses ownership to make sure that we do not accidentally read in a file which has nothing to do with us, but merely happens to use the same name. Thus it is an error to read a file whose ownership does not agree with our declaration. Saying that a file is owned by &quot;another project&quot; allows us to read it whatever the owner is (so this can be used for files shared between multiple projects); specifying exactly where it needs to come from allows us to pass information from one project to another. Note that we identify projects using the IFID number - this can be found in the Contents index for a project, or by typing VERSION during play; see the chapter on Publishing for more about IFIDs.
<p>
<p>Files are indexed in the Contents index, alongside figures and sound effects.
<p>
<p>Two technicalities. First, constants such as &quot;File of Glaciers&quot; are of a kind of value called &quot;external file&quot; (compare &quot;figure name&quot; and &quot;sound name&quot;). Second, Inform's file-handling is provided for the Glulx machine, which in turn uses the Glk interface. This allows for either text or binary files. Inform's higher-level phrases to do with files, described in this chapter, all use text files, and all declared files are text files by default. But we can optionally add the keyword &quot;binary&quot; to declare a binary file, if needed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The binary File of Glaciation Data is called &quot;icedata&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
