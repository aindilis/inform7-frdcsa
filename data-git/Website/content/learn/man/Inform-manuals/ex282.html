<p>In practice it is not enough to apply &quot;if&quot; to a single phrase alone: we want to give a whole list of phrases to be followed repeatedly, or to be followed only if a condition holds.
<p>
<p>We do this by grouping them together, and there are two ways to do this. One is as follows:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To comment upon (whatever - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is transparent, say &quot;I see right through this!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is an open door:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Oh look, an open door!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is openable, say &quot;But you could always shut it.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here we group two phrases together under the same &quot;if&quot;. Note that the &quot;then&quot; has been replaced by a colon, and that the indentation in the list of phrases shows how they are grouped together. In the example above, the source moves two tabs in from the margin; the maximum allowed is 25.
<p>
<p>Indentation is the convention used in this manual and in the examples, but not everybody likes this Pythonesque syntax. So Inform also recognises a more explicit form, in which the beginning and ending are marked with the words &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To comment upon (whatever - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is transparent, say &quot;I see right through this!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is an open door
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Oh look, an open door!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is openable, say &quot;But you could always shut it.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Pythonesque because it's a style popularised by the programming language Python, named in turn after &quot;Monty Python's Flying Circus&quot;.)

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e282"><a href=doc174.html#e282 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 173:  Princess and the Pea</b></a><br>The player is unable to sleep on a mattress (or stack of mattresses) because the bottom one has something uncomfortable under it.<p>

<p>
<p>The main point here is that we need to figure out where the stack meets the floor:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Princess and the Pea&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Topmost Turret is a room. A mattress is a kind of supporter. A mattress is always enterable. A mattress is portable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A large mattress is a mattress in the Turret. A medium mattress is a mattress in the Turret. A small mattress is a mattress in the Turret.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of sleeping when the player is on a mattress (called the bed):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the item be the bed;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the holder of the item is not a room:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the item be the holder of the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can still feel something very uncomfortable under [the item].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of sleeping:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can't sleep standing up!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of looking under a mattress, say &quot;You scout around, but are unable to determine what's causing you this discomfort. If only your maid Winnie were here. She's very good at this.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;sleep / enter small / sleep / get up / get small / put small on medium / get on small / sleep / get up / g / get medium / put medium on large / get on small / look / sleep&quot;.
