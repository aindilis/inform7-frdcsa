<p>IF authors often provide clues or background information to the player by means of radio broadcasts, TV shows or video tapes because they can talk to the player without needing to listen back, or to react to what the player does. The simplest radio set, like the one in <b>Aftershock</b>, really only has one thing to say: which is serendipitously being broadcast just at the moment the player tunes in (regardless of when that is). The next simplest approach is to spool a broadcast on an endless loop taking several turns to play through, as in <b>Radio Daze</b>.
<p>
<p>Televisions come in all shapes and sizes, and <b>Aspect</b> allows their shape (&quot;aspect ratio&quot;) to be described by the player.
<p>
<p>In <b>Channel 1</b>, we can also refer to the television by what it is currently showing: thus WATCH CHANNEL 4 will work if the set is indeed tuned to 4. In <b>Channel 2</b>, numbered channel changing is taken further: we can now TUNE TV TO CHANNEL 3, as well. <b>Channel 2</b> is a reasonable base implementation of a television for many purposes.

<p>Named properties are not the only kind that Inform is able to understand referring to an object. We can also use unit and number properties to distinguish things from one another, as here, where televisions have aspect ratios:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Aspect&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An aspect ratio is a kind of value. 16:9 specifies an aspect ratio.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A television is a kind of device. A television has an aspect ratio. Understand the aspect ratio property as referring to a television. Understand &quot;European standard&quot; as 16:9.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Office is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The widescreen TV is a television in the Office. The fifties TV is a television in the Office. The widescreen TV is 16:9. The fifties TV is 4:3.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;examine european standard tv / x 16:9 tv / x 4:3 tv&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
