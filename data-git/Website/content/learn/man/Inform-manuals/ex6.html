Defining new assertion verbs</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Here is an example definition of a new verb:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to sport (he sports, they sport, he sported, it is sported, he is sporting) implies the wearing relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Once this is done, we can write the assertion
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Wickham sports a Tory rosette.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which will do the the same thing as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Wickham wears a Tory rosette.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because both verbs have the same relation as their meaning.
<p>
<p>Note that we have to spell out many parts of the verb:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">to sport - infinitive
<br>he sports - present singular
<br>they sport - present plural
<br>he sported - past
<br>it is sported - past participle
<br>he is sporting - present participle
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Although it looks as if Inform could easily generate these given the infinitive &quot;to sport&quot; alone, by adding an &quot;-s&quot; here or an &quot;-ed&quot; there, English can be a very irregular language. Since only a few verbs will be defined in any single project it seems best to be explicit. (If we do miss out any of the parts of the verb, the result will be that the usages missed out will not be understood by Inform. Sometimes that's a good thing, as some verbs have seldom-used present participles, for instance - &quot;he is liking me&quot;, for instance, is grammatical but odd.)
<p>
<p>Occasionally it's convenient to have the relation the other way around. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to grace (he graces, they grace, he graced, it is graced, it is gracing) implies the reversed wearing relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>With that defined, these two sentences have identical meanings:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Wickham sports a Tory rosette.
<br>A Tory rosette graces Mr Wickham.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Reversed in this sense means that the things related - the subject and object of the verb - are the other way round.
<p>
<p>The Phrasebook index contains all the verbs associated with assertions, in the &quot;table of verbs&quot; section. When we add new verbs to our source, those will appear in the Phrasebook as well.
<p>
<p>The verbs above (&quot;to grace&quot;, &quot;to sport&quot;) are short ones, but we're free to make them longer than that. For example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to cover oneself with (he covers himself with, they cover themselves with, he covered himself with, he is covering himself with) implies the wearing relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Peter is covering himself with a tent-like raincoat.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here we have &quot;to cover oneself with&quot;, four words long; the limit is 29.
