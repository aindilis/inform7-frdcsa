Obedient Characters</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Other characters can perform all the same activities that the player can; this does not always mean that they're willing to obey the player's instructions. By default, characters will refuse to obey commands of the form JULIA, WEST or ANTONY, TAKE THE PINCUSHION. Their objections can be overridden, however, and <b>The Hypnotist of Blois</b> implements a hypnotist who can make characters obedient at will.
<p>
<p>In <b>For Demonstration Purposes</b>, the character is only capable of a few actions at the outset, but can be taught new ones if the player performs them first.
<p>
<p>Often we want characters' obedience to be more selective. Just as the viewpoint character may be characterized in terms of what he will and will not do, so may others: <b>Generation X</b> demonstrates a character who will do what she's told, but who will comment unfavorably when the player asks for a nonsensical or repeated action, and who may eventually get fed up and leave.
<p>
<p>Characters can be given moral objections to certain commands, as well: <b>Virtue</b> defines a few kinds of actions as bad, so that the character commanded will refuse to perform them.
<p>
<p><b>Under Contract</b>, more subtly, has the character object if the player's commands implicitly require any behavior he considers inappropriate: for instance, if the player commands him to put his pants in a container, he will work out that this requires the removal of the pants as a preliminary. If we want to implement a similar character, we may want to simply copy his unsuccessful attempt rule and the table of his retorts, then replace his banter with lines of our choosing.
<p>
<p>The little example <b>Latin Lessons</b> allows us to make characters clever about vague commands: we can, for instance, write rules so that CLARK, EAT will have Clark sensibly pick something edible, rather than having the parser ask what we want Clark to eat.
<p>
<p>Finally, <b>Northstar</b> demonstrates how we might make Inform understand commands of the form ASK JOSH TO TAKE INVENTORY or ORDER JOAN TO WEAR THE ARMOR.

<p>
<p>There are quite a few actions for which no automatic other-character behavior is provided at all, because they always end in failure when the player tries them. Currently the response is not very interesting. Let's spice it up a bit:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Burning something is useless action. Waking up is useless action. Thinking is useless action. Cutting is useless action. Jumping is useless action. Tying something to something is useless action. Drinking something is useless action. Swinging is useless action.  Rubbing is useless action. Setting something to something is useless action. Waving hands is useless action. Buying is useless action. Singing is useless action. Climbing is useless action. Sleeping is useless action. Kissing is useless action. Throwing something at something is useless action. Attacking is useless action. Asking something about something is useless action. Telling something about something is useless action. Answering something that something is useless action. Waking something is useless action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A persuasion rule for asking people to try useless action:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Clark Gable frowns. 'I don't mean to be difficult, but I can't see any point in that.'&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persuasion fails.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A persuasion rule for asking Clark to try taking off the pants:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;He gives you a look of mocking exasperation. Apparently you'll have to take a (slightly) more subtle approach.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persuasion fails.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check someone giving something to someone (this is the can't give worn items rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the person asked wears the noun, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And because we do not want Clark automatically taking off the pants as the result of a drop action:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of Clark taking off the pants: do nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We know that this can only come about as a default action, because we have arranged matters so that he cannot be persuaded directly.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;give dress to clark / clark, take off pants / clark, sing / clark, eat pants / clark, give me the pants / clark, drop pants / clark, put the pants in the briefcase / again / g / g / g&quot;
