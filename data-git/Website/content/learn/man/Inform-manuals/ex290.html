<p>
<p>Interactive fictions vary considerably in the extent to which the player is allowed to influence the story-line. Sometimes the appearance of making choices is wholly bogus, as only one possible line is given more than lip service. But in other works, the player can radically change the outcome, and whole rafts of plot differ between one person's experience and another's. Inform allows multiple endings to its scenes to make this kind of branching story-line easy to achieve.
<p>
<p>Any scene can have up to 8 alternate endings, differentiated by name. These are created as and when conditions are set for them:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Brief Encounter ends happily when ...
<br>Brief Encounter ends wisely but sadly when ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Ends happily&quot; and &quot;ends wisely but sadly&quot; behave just like &quot;ends&quot;. We can have rules &quot;When Brief Encounter ends happily, ...&quot; and so forth, in addition to rules &quot;When Brief Encounter ends, ...&quot; - if a rule doesn't specify any particular ending, it applies to all of them.
<p>
<p>We can also link rules together from these branches, so
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Stranger's Acceptance begins when Brief Encounter ends happily.
<br>Stranger's Rejection begins when Brief Encounter ends wisely but sadly.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>With this set-up and that of the previous section, there are now two possible paths through the story:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">(i) Train Stop - Brief Encounter - Stranger's Acceptance - Bittersweet Ending
<br>(ii) Train Stop - Brief Encounter - Stranger's Rejection - Bittersweet Ending
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We might later need to know which of these paths has been taken, and to help with this Inform provides conditions like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if Brief Encounter ended happily ...
<br>if Brief Encounter did not end happily ...
<br>if Brief Encounter ended wisely but sadly ...
<br>if Brief Encounter did not end wisely but sadly ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(For a scene which repeats, note that these conditions apply only to the most recent repetition: and that such conditions are always false if the scene is currently going on. &quot;Brief Encounter did not end happily&quot; will be true only when the scene has finished but in a different way.)

The description of a distraction is usually &quot;[The item described] is not the point of this story.&quot; The shirt and the trousers are wearable. The description of the trousers is &quot;Borrowed from your oldest brother, who is only a year younger than you. They are too long for your legs and overly snug at the hip, but no one around here pays much attention to fashion, and you're getting away with it, more or less.&quot; After examining the trousers, increment the clue count of Beauty.

The description of the skirt is &quot;Made for you by your mother, and it looks quite pretty on you.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increment clue count of Beauty;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting during dramatic revelation: say &quot;You wait for the penny to drop, for her to understand.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Dramatic revelation ends in failure when waiting or the time since dramatic revelation began is five minutes. When dramatic revelation ends in failure:

<p>

<p>And now, since we don't really want to return to the rest of the 'marriage proposal' scene once she has learned our ID:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Marriage proposal ends in distraction when Dramatic Revelation ends in success.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Compromise proposal is a scene. Compromise proposal begins when Dramatic Revelation ends in success. When Compromise Proposal begins: now Beauty is passive.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now Beauty is passive;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[reply entry][paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blank out the whole row.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn during Compromise Proposal:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Beauty is active and Beauty is visible:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat through Table of Secondary Conversation:

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn: now Beauty is active.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Notice that we moved the re-activation rule down here so that the Compromise Proposal rule would fire first. There are other more complicated ways of handling order of every turn rules than by relying on text sequence alone; but we will save that for a later chapter. For now it is sufficient to depend on the order in which the rules are declared.
