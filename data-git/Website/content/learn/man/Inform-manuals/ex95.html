Indexed text in variables, properties and tables</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>So far we have been able to ignore the difference between &quot;text&quot; and &quot;indexed text&quot; because Inform has always been able to convert the former to the latter when needed. But the reverse conversion cannot be made. Ordinary text is stored in a specially compacted, read-only form: it's really part of the program, not part of the data.
<p>
<p>The upshot of this is that if we need a variable to contain text which can be internally altered during play, then we must declare this. Instead of writing
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player's forename is a text that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>we must write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player's forename is an indexed text that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Similarly for a property:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person has an indexed text called nickname.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For a named &quot;let&quot; value, we have a dilemma. These are normally created by writing something like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let the target be 17;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and Inform looks at the value - here 17, a number - to deduce that the new value, called &quot;target&quot;, must be a number. So if we write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let the target be &quot;excellent&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>the result is that &quot;target&quot; is just a text, not an indexed text. We get around this by writing instead:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let the target be an indexed text;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which creates the value, initially having the empty text as contents, and then
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let the target be &quot;excellent&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>to subsequently set its initial state.
<p>
<p>The same issue arises for table columns, because we are allowed to simply write out values in table columns, and let Inform work out what kind they are. If there are blank entries, we can always write in the kind of value by hand, but suppose the entries are initially all filled in? The answer is that we can imitate this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Table of Neptune's Moons
<br><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">moon</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">surface (indexed text)</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;Nereid&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;utterly unknown&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;Triton&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;cryovolcanic ridges&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;Proteus&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;highly irregular and sooty&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here the two columns are called &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;surface&quot;, so we can talk about the &quot;moon entry&quot; and the &quot;surface entry&quot; once a row has been chosen: but the moon entry is text, and the surface entry is indexed text.
<p>
<p>Lastly, suppose we want to define new phrases which deal with text. Here we have two things to remember. First, we need to say that the value decided is indexed text, not text; secondly, that text converts to indexed text by magic, but not vice versa. So:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what indexed text is (T - text) doubled:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on &quot;[T][T]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>works fine so long as we only want to pass text to it, but would not let us double indexed text. This, on the other hand, handles both:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what indexed text is (T - indexed text) doubled:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on &quot;[T][T]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;Neptune&quot; doubled.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>prints &quot;NeptuneNeptune&quot; because Inform automatically converts &quot;Neptune&quot; to indexed text when &quot;doubled&quot; is used on it.

<a name="e95"><a href=doc346.html#e95 STYLE="text-decoration: none">**<b><b>Example</b> 407:  The Cow Exonerated</b></a><br>Creating a class of matches that burn for a time and then go out, with elegant reporting when several matches go out at once.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Here we create a class of matches that can be used to burn other objects. Our objectives are as follow:
<p>
<p>Burned objects other than matches should be removed from play instantly (just as edible objects are instantly eaten). We could give everything its own burning duration, but that complicates matters and allows for fire to spread from one object to another; for an example of how to do that, see the example &quot;In Fire or in Flood&quot;.
<p>
<p>Matches should be described to show whether they are burning or extinguished, and when the parser chooses one of several identical matches, it should make very clear which match it has selected.
<p>
<p>The game must sensibly select and, if necessary, automatically light new matches to carry out a >BURN THING command.
<p>
<p>The matches must burn for a set number of turns before going out, never to be used again.
<p>
<p>And finally, the part for which the indexed text will be useful: when several matches go out in the same turn, we want the game to print
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Four matches go out.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>rather than
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A match goes out.
<br>A match goes out.
<br>A match goes out.
<br>A match goes out.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This last function appears down in Section 3, if we wish to skip ahead and look at it.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The word &quot;matches&quot; is used by Inform to compare snippets of text (see &quot;Reading a command&quot; in the Activities chapter). This can sometimes cause awkwardness if we also have a kind called &quot;match&quot;, so for the occasion we will give our matches a more specialized name, never visible to the player:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A strikable-match is a kind of thing. The plural of strikable-match is s-matches.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A strikable-match has a number called duration. The duration of a strikable-match is usually 3.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of a strikable-match: say &quot;match&quot;.
