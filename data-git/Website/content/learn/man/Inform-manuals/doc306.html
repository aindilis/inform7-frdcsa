<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> See &quot;printing the locale description&quot;. This activity is expected to decide which items ought to be mentioned in a locale description for a given room, enterable container or enterable supporter, and to give each item a priority, which is a number ranging upwards from 1 (which is the top priority). The lower the priority number, the earlier the mention, or at least, the earlier the opportunity to be mentioned: it's up to other activities whether to give it a paragraph of its own or not. This activity only makes something a candidate, and decides what order the candidates will be tried in.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> By default, this activity contains only the &quot;standard notable locale objects rule&quot;. This chooses exactly those items directly contained by the locale, assigning all of them priority 5. Note that this includes scenery, and other probably unwanted items - those will be excluded later.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) In the Misty Moorlands, only large items on the ground are visible through the mist:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be large or small. A thing is usually small. The stepladder is a large thing in the Misty Moorlands.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for choosing notable locale objects for the Misty Moorlands:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through large things in the Misty Moorlands:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set the locale priority of the item to 5.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report taking a small thing in the Misty Moorlands:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You grope blindly in the mist and pick up [the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note the special phrase
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">set the locale priority of the item to 5;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which should be used only in rules for locale activities. It makes the given item a candidate and sets its priority. (Setting the priority to 0 forces an item not to be a candidate, and can thus undo the effect of previous rules.)
