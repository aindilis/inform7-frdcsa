<p>Once we begin applying rules to actions which are not entirely known in advance, we have a problem: there's no way to find out what specifically is happening. Consider the following:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining something, say &quot;It is none of your concern!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is fine as far as it goes, but clumsy. What if the player had examined a human being? Then &quot;it&quot; would be inappropriate. A better approach would be this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining something, say &quot;[The noun] is none of your concern!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;noun&quot; and, when necessary, the &quot;second noun&quot; are values which can be used in any rule about actions, and it follows that they can also be substituted into text, as this example demonstrates. Results might include:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Lady Bracknell is none of your concern!
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The silver cigarette case is none of your concern!
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This seems a good moment to mention that if you use &quot;The&quot; in a substitution, then a capitalised &quot;The&quot; will be used so long as this is grammatically correct (Lady Bracknell, as a proper noun, takes no article); &quot;the&quot; becomes a lower-case &quot;the&quot; along the same lines; and &quot;a&quot; a lower-case indefinite article.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining something in the Drawing Room, say &quot;Under Lady Bracknell's eye, you feel constrained. Besides, it is only [a noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
