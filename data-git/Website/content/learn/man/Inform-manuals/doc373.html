<p>Inform provides basic support for displaying pictures and leaves more exotic effects for Extensions to provide. But either way, for reasons explained in the previous section, <b>we can only have pictures if the Settings for the project are set to the Glulx story file format</b>.
<p>
<p>Inform calls these pictures &quot;figures&quot;, following the usual Inform analogy with books. We will think of our work of IF as being like a mostly textual book which in broken up with illustrations here and there - Figure 1, Figure 2, and so on. These might be used to mark each new chapter of the plot, or each new location: whatever the author would like. So the first thing we need to do is decide when pictures should appear.
<p>
<p>The second thing to do is to get hold of the pictures we want to use. These might be photographs, or artwork, or diagrams: anything, really, but we will need them to be in either JPEG or PNG format. Inform does not itself try to be an image editor, or an artwork program - there are many such programs already which do these things much better than Inform could.
<p>
<p>The pictures then need to be put in a special place where Inform can reach them. Suppose the Inform project is called Example.inform. Then we need to create a folder alongside it called &quot;Example Materials&quot;, and create a further folder inside that called &quot;Figures&quot;. The actual images go inside &quot;Figures&quot;. So we might then have files like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Example.inform
<br>Example Materials
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodlands.png
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackberry.jpg
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Admiral Butterfly.png
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The Materials folder for an Inform work will turn out to have many other uses in the chapter on Publishing, and will be explained further there.
