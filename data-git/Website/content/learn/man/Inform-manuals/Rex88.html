<p>
<p>A work of IF contains many spectacles and activities, and these must not all present themselves at once, or the player will be overwhelmed. One way to spread them out is in time, by having them available only as a plot develops, but another is to spread them out literally in space. The player has to walk between the Library and the Swimming Pool, and thus bookish and athletic tasks are not both presenting themselves at once. There have been valiant &quot;one-room&quot; IFs, and it forms a respectable sub-genre of the art, but most works of any size need a map.
<p>
<p>Inform, following IF conventions, divides the world up into locations called &quot;rooms&quot;, connected together by so-called &quot;map connections&quot; along compass bearings. Thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Library is east of the Swimming Pool.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The example <b>Port Royal 1</b> develops a medium-sized map from such sentences. This develops in <b>Port Royal 2</b> to include connections which bend around, allowing the rooms not to lie on an imaginary square grid.
<p>
<p>Because it is useful to group rooms together under names describing whole areas, Inform also allows rooms to be placed in &quot;regions&quot;. Thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Campus Area is a region. The Library and the Swimming Pool are in the Campus Area.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p><b>Port Royal 3</b> demonstrates this further. <b>A&E</b> shows how regions can be used to write simple rules which regulate access to and from whole areas of the map.
<p>
<p>Many old-school IF puzzles involve journeys through the map which are confused, randomised or otherwise frustrated: see <b>Bee Chambers</b> for a typical maze, <b>Zork II</b> for a randomised connection, <b>Prisoner's Dilemma</b> for a change in the map occurring during play. A completely random map takes us away from traditional IF and more towards a different sort of old-school game, the computerised role-playing game with its endless quests through dungeons with randomly generated treasures and monsters. This style of map - building itself one step at a time, as the player explores - can sometimes be useful to provide an illusion of infinite expanse: see <b>All Roads Lead To Mars</b>.
<p>
<p>While the standard compass directions are conventional in IF, there are times when we may want to replace them without other forms of directional relationship. <b>Indirection</b> renames the compass directions to correspond to primary colors, as in Mayan thinking. <b>The World of Charles S. Roberts</b> substitutes new ones, instead, introducing a hex-grid map in place of the usual one.

<p>
<p>In Mayan culture, colours seem to have been used as names for the primary directions: for instance, &quot;red&quot; implies east as the colour of sunrise. So the following might be a stylish touch for a game in which the player has to get inside the Mayan world-view:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Indirection&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;white&quot; and &quot;sac&quot; as north. Understand &quot;red&quot; and &quot;chac&quot; as east. Understand &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;kan&quot; as south. Understand &quot;black&quot; and &quot;chikin&quot; as west.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We could also use a colour as a verb:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;turquoise&quot; and &quot;yax&quot; as looking.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now a few extra rooms to try it out in:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Square Chamber is a room. &quot;A sunken, gloomy stone chamber, ten yards across. A shaft of sunlight cuts in from the steps above, giving the chamber a diffuse light, but in the shadows low lintelled doorways to east and south lead into the deeper darkness of the Temple.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Wormcast is east of the Square Chamber. The Corridor is south of the Square Chamber.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;kan / white / chac / black&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
