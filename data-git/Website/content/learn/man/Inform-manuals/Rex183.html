<p>
<p>A person can wear any (portable) thing which has the &quot;wearable&quot; property. (This property seldom needs to be quoted because it is deduced automatically from sentences like &quot;Trevor wears a red hat.&quot;)
<p>
<p>In most traditional IF, clothing is only used when it is exceptional in some way. That is, we ignore the three to eight different garments most people are wearing at any given time - the everyday clothes which people wear without thinking about them - and only simulate the unexpected extras: a borrowed jaunty red hat, a radiation-proof space suit, and so on.
<p>
<p>These unusual garments turn up only occasionally in play and usually one at a time, so Inform does not normally provide rules to restrict how much or little is worn, or in what unlikely combinations. <b>Get Me to the Church on Time</b> categorises clothing by body area (trousers for lower body, shirts for upper); <b>Bogart</b> by layer, distinguishing underwear from outer garments. <b>What Not To Wear</b> combines both into a general-purpose system adequate for most kinds of clothing situations.

<p><b>Hayes Code</b> is a somewhat stripped down version.
<p>
<p>Clothes are normally single things which have no function other than display and concealment, but <b>Being Prepared</b> gives them pockets which act as containers, and <b>Some Assembly Required</b> allows clothes to be stitched together from pieces of cloth.

<p>The following burlesque was considered too much for the tender readers of Chapter 3, since it involved explicit use of listing and persuasion:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Hays Code&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Movie Set is a room. Clark Gable is a man in the Movie Set. &quot;Clark leans on a polystyrene pillar, wearing [a list of unconcealed things worn by Clark] with his usual aplomb.&quot; Persuasion rule for asking Clark to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Clark is wearing a pin-striped suit and a pink thong. Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of Clark: if the particular possession is the thong and Clark is wearing the suit, yes; otherwise no.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;clark, remove suit / look / clark, remove thong / look&quot;.
