Ropes</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Ropes, chains and similar long, thin, bendable items present three problems: they are like a liquid in that (unless unbreakable) they can be divided arbitrarily into smaller and smaller portions of themselves, they can be in two or more places at once (even in two or more rooms at once), and they can be tied down at either or both ends, allowing them to occupy an uneasy state in between being &quot;portable&quot; and &quot;fixed in place&quot;. Even when all this is simulated, they allow us to pull on one end and so to exert force at the other - allowing action-at-a-distance which Inform's realism rules would ordinarily forbid. Ropes are hard. And it is very difficult to imagine everything a player might try when given a fully practical rope with which to solve puzzles.
<p>
<p><b>Snip</b> solves the divisibility question, allowing string to be cut or retied into lengths of any size, with all the consequences for describing and understanding that this entails.
<p>
<p><b>Otranto</b> provides a lengthy but straightforward approach to the other rope-related issues, subject to the simplifying assumptions that a rope is indivisible, has about the length of the distance between two adjacent rooms, and cannot be tied to another rope.

<p>The range of things one might want to do with a rope in a work of interactive fiction is fairly overwhelming. One might, in theory, swing from ropes; use them to tie containers shut; cut them up into smaller ropes; tie them together into longer ropes; employ them as fuses; bind other characters with them, or the player character.
<p>
<p>Our rope implementation is, by these lights, reasonably simple, but it does account for the possibility of tying and untying both ends; using ropes to descend into lower rooms; pulling objects tied to the far end of the rope; and dragging objects from place to place.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Otranto&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We start by coming up with a rope.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A rope is a kind of thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is nonrope if it is not a rope. [The perfect idiocy of this statement notwithstanding, having a shortcut will come in very handy later]
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Attachment relates things to each other in groups. The verb to be stuck to implies the attachment relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is tied if the number of things stuck to it is greater than 1.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is free if it is not tied.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a rope is free if the number of nonrope things stuck to it is less than 2.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is hindering if it is stuck to the noun and it is not within the location.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be round or unevenly shaped. A thing is usually round.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: something is anchored if it is fixed in place or it is scenery or it is part of an anchored thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: something is draggable if it is not had by the player and it is not the player and it is not anchored.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now, we want a rope to be described in terms of the way it is tied, when it's described in a room description.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about a rope (called the coil):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the coil is stuck to something which is in a room (called the next room) which is not the location:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the way be the best route from the location to the next room;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the way is up or the way is down:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The coil] runs [way] into [the next room].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The coil] snakes across the floor [way] towards [the next room].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;There is [a coil] here[if the coil is stuck to a visible nonrope thing], tied to [the list of nonrope visible things which are stuck to the coil][end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what room is the home of (item - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if item is a door:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let front cut be the number of moves from the location to the front side of the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let back cut be the number of moves from the location to the back side of the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if front cut is -1, let front cut be 999;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if back cut is -1, let back cut be 999;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location encloses the item, decide on the location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if front cut is greater than back cut, decide on the back side of the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on the front side of the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on the location of the item.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about a nonrope thing (called the anchor) which is stuck to a rope (called the coil):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the coil is in an adjacent room:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the next room be the home of the coil;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the way be the best route from the location to the next room;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the way is up or the way is down:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The coil] runs [way] from [the anchor] into [the next room].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;From [the anchor] runs [a coil], heading off toward [the way].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the coil is stuck to something which is not visible,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The coil] is tied to [the anchor][if the coil is stuck to something in an adjacent room (called the next room)], and from there runs off towards [the next room][end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We need a way to account for it when it's being carried, as well.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the name of a rope (called the tied object) while taking inventory:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if something nonrope is stuck to the tied object:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot; (attached to [the list of nonrope things which are stuck to the tied object])&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot; (with both ends free)&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And, indeed, whenever the player examines a rope, we should see what's connected.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining a rope when something is stuck to the rope:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] is tied to [the list of secondary things which are stuck to the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Similarly, any time the player looks at something tied to a rope.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After examining the player when the player is stuck to something which is not the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You're currently lashed to [the list of secondary things stuck to the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After examining something which is stuck to something secondary:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] is currently attached to [the list of secondary things stuck to the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We also need to make sure that the rope can be interacted with properly even when it's partly in the next room.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if something stuck to a rope (called the coil) is in the location, place the coil in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A reaching inside rule:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the anchor be a random visible thing stuck to the noun;

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now tying:

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before tying something to a rope:

<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Musician's Gallery is above the Castle Hall. &quot;Of its former cheery aspect only this remains to the Gallery: that chevrons of red and yellow are painted on the wall. But as these are streaked with rain and grime, the banister pulled away, the roof open to the sky, and the corners made a nesting place for birds, the consolation thereby afforded is but slight.&quot;

<blockquote><font color="#000080">The pointed door is north of the Musician's Gallery and south of the Sinister Attic. It is a closed locked openable door. &quot;A pointed door of particularly grim and uninviting aspect leads north.&quot; The pointed door is lockable and unevenly shaped. The description of the pointed door is &quot;A door coming to a gothic point and fitted with iron fittings of great strength. The handle looks particularly well-attached.&quot; The iron key unlocks the pointed door.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of opening the pointed door for the first time:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;When you rattle at the door, there arises from beyond a terrible shrill noise as though something beyond exults in its imminent release.&quot;

<blockquote><font color="#000080">After opening the trapped pointed door when the player can see the pointed door:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Thousands of bats fly from the pointed door, attacking you!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the story.
