<p>
<p>Not all characters are friendly, and there are times when we may want to include a fight sequence. There are a number of ways to approach this, depending on whether we want to offer the player a random outcome, a predetermined one, or a combat sequence that depends partly on strategy or on having the proper equipment.
<p>
<p><b>Lanista 1</b> demonstrates randomized combat in the style of a role-playing game. The player has a partially random chance of doing any given amount of damage; both the player and his opponent have hit points, and whichever one runs out first dies. <b>Lanista 2</b> continues this idea, but includes weapons that affect the amount of of damage done. <b>Red Cross</b> by itself implements a command that we might use to find out how strong characters are at the moment.
<p>
<p>A word of warning about designing such sequences: a player who gets a roll he doesn't like always has the option of UNDOing a turn and re-rolling. This means that he can always win a random battle sooner or later; bad luck only means that it takes him longer (so he gets more bored and irritated as he plays through). It is possible to turn off UNDO implementation with
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use UNDO prevention.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...but there is a good chance that this will irritate players in itself. Role-playing-style combat scenarios need careful design, lest they actively make a game less fun.
<p>
<p>In a slightly more realistic setting, combat leaves physical remains behind, unless we're wielding some kind of futuristic weapon that evaporates our opponents entirely: <b>Puff of Orange Smoke</b> demonstrates characters who leave corpses behind when they die, while <b>Technological Terror</b> more tamely explodes robots into numerous component parts.
<p>
<p>Finally, we can imagine some scenarios in which, instead of allowing characters to strike at each other for random damage, we want to introduce an element of strategy. <b>Don Pedro's Revenge</b> shows the rudiments of a system in which the characters can make different kinds of attack depending on where they are in a room filled with perches, barrels, and other swashbuckler props.

<p>Suppose our game features a detailed simulated combat between the player character and his opponent. He might have several weapons available, and several types of attack available; and at any given time he might be perched up in the rigging of his ship, standing on the open deck, or boxed in between some barrels. His options will vary depending on his position, and obviously it would detract from the pacing to make the player keep LOOKing in the middle of combat in order to remind himself where he is. Instead, we'll roll this information into the command prompt:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Don Pedro's Revenge&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Deck of the Helene Marie is a room. &quot;The two crews are embattled all around you, but your attention is reserved for your particular enemy: Don Pedro.&quot;

<p>Of course, this won't be much fun until we also provide the player with a few weapons, some more fighting maneuvers, and, most of all, a Don Pedro to defeat.
