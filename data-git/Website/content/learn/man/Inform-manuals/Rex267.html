Reading Matter</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Many things can be read, from warning notices to encyclopaedias, and a range of techniques is needed to provide them because the quantity of text, and how it presents itself, can vary so much. With a small amount of very large type, the player should not need any command at all to read the text:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The road sign is in the Junction. The road sign is fixed in place. &quot;A road sign points north: 'Weston on the Green - 6'.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If the print is smaller, or the object portable, the player will expect to use the EXAMINE command:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The business card is in the Junction. The description is &quot;'Peter de S√®vres: consultant mnemonicist.'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But if the object is a leaflet, say, EXAMINE should only describe the cover: READ would be the command a player would expect to use to get at the text itself. Inform normally defines READ to be the same command as EXAMINE, which is good for things like the business card, but counter-productive here. <b>The Trouble with Printing</b> shows how to separate these two commands, allowing any thing to have a property called its &quot;printing&quot; for text produced by READ, which will be different from its &quot;description&quot;, the text produced by EXAMINE.
<p>
<p>If the object is a lengthy diary, say, nobody would read it from cover to cover in a single IF turn. We might then want to allow the player to turn the pages one by one, with commands like READ PAGE 4 IN DIARY or READ THE NEXT PAGE: see <b>Pages</b>.
<p>
<p>If the object is an encyclopaedic reference work, the player would consult named entries: see <b>Costa Rican Ornithology</b>, which allows commands like LOOK UP QUETZAL IN GUIDE.
<p>
<p>Still larger sources of text often occur in IF: libraries or bookshelves, where many books are found together, and it is clumsy to write them as many individual items. One approach is to simulate an entire bookshelf with a single thing: see <b>Bibliophilia</b>. (This is much like looking up topics in a single book, except that each topic is a book in itself.) Another is to provide each book as an individual item, but have them automatically join together into a single portable collection: see <b>AARP-Gnosis</b>.
<p>
<p>Signs, leaflets and encyclopaedias, being printed, have a wording which will never change during play. But sometimes the player reads something which acts of its own accord. Text substitutions are usually all that is needed to achieve this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The computer display is on the desk. The description is &quot;Giant green digits read: [the time of day].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is easy because we know all the variations we want. But what if we want the player to write his own text, for instance, adding to a diary? This is trickier, because it means storing text as the player typed it, and replaying it later. (And suppose the player types reams and reams of text, not just a few words as we might have hoped?) <b>The Fourth Body</b> and <b>The Fifth Body</b> show how to use an external file - a multimedia trick requiring features only available if the project is set to the Glulx story file format - to handle even the most difficult cases.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e267"><a href=Rdoc73.html#e267 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 292:  Pages</b></a><br>A book with pages that can be read by number (as in "read page 3 in...") and which accepts relative page references as well (such as "read the last page of...", "read the next page", and so on).<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we have a book that the player must consult page-by-page, and we want to be able to accept all of the following input:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">> READ BOOK (to choose a random page and read it)
<br>> READ PAGE 1 IN BOOK
<br>> READ PAGE 2
<br>> READ THE LAST PAGE OF THE BOOK
<br>> READ THE NEXT PAGE
<br>> READ PREVIOUS PAGE IN BOOK
<br>> READ THE FIRST PAGE
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>One approach would be to write many different understand rules and actions: one action for reading randomly, one for reading a specific page, one for reading the first page, one for reading the previous page, one for reading the next page, and one for reading the last page. But this gets tedious to construct and maintain.
<p>
<p>More usefully, we could consider that all of the last four options are essentially the same action at heart: the player is asking to read a page in the book using a name rather than a number, and we will have to perform a minor calculation to discover what the number should be. Here's an implementation using named values to resolve this problem:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;Pages&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Library is a room. The sinister book is carried by the player. The sinister book has a number called the last page read. The sinister book has a number called the length. The length of the sinister book is 50.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the command &quot;read&quot; as something new.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;read [something]&quot; or &quot;consult [something]&quot; or &quot;read in/from [something]&quot; as reading. Reading is an action applying to one thing, requiring light.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;read [number] in/from/of [something]&quot; or &quot;read page [number] in/from/of [something]&quot; or &quot;look up page [number] in/from/of [something]&quot; or &quot;consult page [number] in/from/of [something]&quot; as reading it in. Reading it in is an action applying to one number and one thing, requiring light.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Named page is a kind of value. The named pages are first page, last page, next page, previous page.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is the effective value of (L - last page):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on the length of the book.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is the effective value of (F - first page):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on 1.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let X be the last page read of the book plus 1;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on X.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is the effective value of (P - previous page):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let X be the last page read of the book minus 1;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;read [named page] in/from/of [something]&quot; or &quot;read the [named page] in/from/of [something]&quot; as reading it relatively in. Reading it relatively in is an action applying to one named page and one thing, requiring light.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Does the player mean reading something in the sinister book: it is very likely.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the book requirement rule:
