<p>
<p>There are sometimes several slightly different ways to perform a given task but which have substantially the same definition. In the following example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To go hiking, into the woods or up the mountain:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if into the woods, say &quot;Watch out for badgers.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if up the mountain, say &quot;Better take your compass.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You go hiking.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...a phrase has been set up which can be used in three ways:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">go hiking;
<br>go hiking, into the woods;
<br>go hiking, up the mountain;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that commas must be used to divide these &quot;phrase options&quot; from the rest of the text of the phrase. Within the definition of the phrase, the option's name is a valid condition, and
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if up the mountain, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>tests whether it is set; we can also test if it is not set using:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if not up the mountain, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>A more substantial example from the Standard Rules is given by a phrase used mostly for internal, technical reasons:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>list the contents of </b>(object)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_listcontents -->

<p>This phrase produces a list of all things whose holder is the given object, according to Inform's traditional conventions for room descriptions and inventory listings. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">list the contents of Marley Wood, as a sentence, with newlines
<br>and including all contents;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Where this is possible, it's generally better to use &quot;[list of things in ...]&quot; instead, which produces the same result in an acceptable way for the middle of a sentence.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>Note that this phrase is allowed to have multiple options specified, whereas &quot;go hiking&quot; above was not: this is because it was defined thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To list the contents of (something - an object), with newlines, indented, as a sentence, including contents, including all contents, giving inventory information, giving brief inventory information, using the definite article, listing marked items only, prefacing with is/are, not listing concealed items, suppressing all articles and/or with extra indentation: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The significant difference is the word &quot;and/or&quot; instead of &quot;or&quot;, which signals that more than one option can apply at a time.
