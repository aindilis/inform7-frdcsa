<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> When an item is listed in the miscellaneous collection of items present in a room (the ones which do not deserve their own paragraphs): this is normally the last paragraph of a room description.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> A bracketed piece of extra information is added for certain items such as containers:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You can also see Po and a cage (empty) here.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot; (empty)&quot; (note initial space) was added by this activity. (Note that this activity is not responsible for describing further items visible because of the item in question: that is, it does not print the text such as &quot;(in which is a notepad)&quot; which would appear if there were contents. If we want to remove such text, we should use &quot;omit contents in listing&quot;: see the activity &quot;for printing the name of something&quot;.)
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) To get rid of such addenda entirely, try:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing room description details: stop.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(b) To add a new form of addendum:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing room description details of a person:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot; (at last, someone to talk to)&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If both examples (a) and (b) are in place at once, we might now read:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You can also see Po (at last, someone to talk to) and a cage here.
</font></blockquote><p>
