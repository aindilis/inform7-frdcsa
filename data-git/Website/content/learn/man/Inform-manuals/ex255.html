<p>The &quot;photographing&quot; action now works very nicely when the player does it. But not when others try. Suppose that neither the player, nor Clark Gable, is holding the camera:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>photograph clark
<br>You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>clark, photograph me
<br>>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>An uncanny silence. What has happened is that the rules written so far are all implicitly restricted to the player only. This is because when we write -
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check photographing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the camera is not carried:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>the action is &quot;photographing&quot;, not &quot;Clark photographing&quot;. In the next few sections we shall see how to make the rules work nicely for everybody. This is a little bit harder, so it should be noted right away that in many projects there is no need. In a game which has no other characters who succumb to persuasion, for instance, only the player will ever try the action.

<p>
<p>Inform has built-in commands for other people, and sometimes we may want to adjust the way these work without completely disabling and replacing the command. Suppose, for instance, that instead of
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Kermit the Frog looks through his possessions.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>we'd like someone taking inventory to report what he's got, thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Kermit the Frog says, &quot;I seem to be carrying a microphone and wearing a hat and a trenchcoat.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To do this, we could replace the built-in report rule with a different one.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Trying Taking Manhattan&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The loud inventory rule is listed instead of the report other people taking inventory rule in the report taking inventory rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the loud inventory rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless the player is the person asked:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The person asked] says, 'I seem to be carrying [a list of things carried by the person asked][if the person asked is wearing something] and wearing [a list of things worn by the person asked][end if].'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Persuasion rule for asking someone to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Grand Central Station is a room. &quot;Here you are in New York, New York. Any minute now someone is going to burst into song.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Kermit the Frog is a man in Grand Central Station. &quot;Kermit the Frog stands nearby, enjoying being green.&quot; Kermit is wearing a hat and a trenchcoat. He is carrying a microphone.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;inventory / kermit, inventory&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
