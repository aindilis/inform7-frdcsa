<p>Sometimes we want Inform to apply a player's action to a different target than the one specified: for instance, directing all (or almost all) commands from the doorknob to the door of which it is a part. <b>Fine Laid</b> demonstrates how to do this. Along the same lines, <b>Lucy</b> shows how to direct a player's conversation action to apply to a new conversation topic.
<p>
<p>We can also record a series of actions performed by the player or by another character.
<p>
<p><b>Cactus Will Outlive Us All</b> demonstrates characters each of whom reacts to a very specific provocation; <b>I Didn't Come All The Way From Great Portland Street</b> implements a game show in which the player is not allowed ever to repeat an action he has already performed; and <b>Leopard-skin</b> implements a maze which the player can escape only by performing a specific sequence of actions.
<p>
<p><b>Anteaters</b> provides a peculiar gizmo that can remember actions performed in its presence and force the player to reiterate them.

<a name="e175"><a href=Rex175.html#e175 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b>Example 423:  I Didn't Come All The Way From Great Portland Street</b></a><br>In this fiendishly difficult puzzle, which may perhaps owe some inspiration to a certain BBC Radio panel game (1967-), a list is used as a set of actions to help enforce the rule that the player must keep going for ten turns without hesitation, repetition, or deviating from the subject on the card.<p>

<a name="e11"><a href=Rex11.html#e11 STYLE="text-decoration: none">**<b>Example 222:  Anteaters</b></a><br>The player carries a gizmo that is able to record actions performed by the player, then force him to repeat them when the gizmo is dropped. This includes storing actions that apply to topics, as in "look up anteater colonies in the guide".<p>
