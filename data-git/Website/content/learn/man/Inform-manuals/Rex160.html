Reactive Characters</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>As we observe characters, so they observe us. Those who seem to have no awareness of what the player is doing often come across more like waxworks than like people. <b>Zodiac</b> demonstrates a scenario where the watchful presence of a dangerous criminal keeps the player from doing what he otherwise might, while <b>Police State</b> expands on this idea with a policeman who reacts to entire types of behavior in his presence, regardless of whether the culprit is the player or a third party. <b>Noisemaking</b> has a crow who will fly away in response to any loud noises the player makes.
<p>
<p>And, of course, we definitely want to have characters react to being looked at or otherwise interfered with. <b>Search and Seizure</b> implements a smuggler who reacts when we try to confiscate his possessions. <b>Pine 1</b> gives us a sleeping princess who can be woken by a variety of methods.
<p>
<p>We wrap up this section with two complete puzzle scenarios that demonstrate what can be achieved by giving characters reactions to the player's behavior. <b>A Day For Fresh Sushi</b> has a fish who watches the player's actions and comments on them, while the live furnishings in <b>Revenge of the Fussy Table</b> instead comment every turn on the current state of the world, until the player has successfully sorted out all their complaints.

<p>This example does include a number of features that we haven't met yet, particularly rulebooks. Nonetheless, the basic idea should be relatively clear. Our premise is that the player is faced with a series of disgruntled furnishings, none of which want to be responsible for supporting the cold, hot, drippy, or spiky objects lying around the room.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 1 - The Supporters
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Dining Room is a room. &quot;A room of handsome proportions, with an octagonal dining table on a fine parquet floor. The original set of chairs has been taken away, leaving only a red velvet dining chair and a blue suede armchair.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The fussy table is a supporter in the Dining Room. It is scenery. The description is &quot;It's hypochondriac: the result of a sojourn in a superior antique shop, where it picked up the scent of almond oil, words like provenance, and a secretive shame about being resurfaced.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Chairs don't get along with it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In its mellowest moods, after a really good dusting, it will mention, casually, a cabinet it once knew, which was twelve feet tall, came from the Winter Palace, and had an asking price of $350K.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A chair is a kind of supporter with carrying capacity 1. A chair is enterable. A chair is usually scenery. Understand &quot;chair&quot; as a chair.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The blue suede armchair and the red velvet dining chair are chairs in the Dining Room. The description of the blue suede is &quot;Quiet, mellow, and with a lingering aroma of clove cigarettes, and possibly something less legal. It doesn't sit up straight, and doesn't let anyone else do so either.&quot; The red velvet has the description &quot;In temperament, in bearing, in everything it is the opposite of the blue suede chair. It is concerned for its duty all the time, has a rigidly straight back, and pokes diners in the spine when it suspects them of overdoing things.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The carrying capacity of the player is 2.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After putting a cold thing on a scalding thing:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the heat of the noun is luke-warm;

<p>
<p>Moreover, every time the player gets close to resolving this issue, his unhelpful companion Alison brings in something else inconvenient. We can use the counting of contented supporters to decide when the player is getting close to winning and it's time for her to bring something else...
<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Tidy Kitchen is south of the Dining Room. Alison is a woman in the Tidy Kitchen. The kettle is a scalding thing. The ceramic tile is a cold portable supporter.

<p>

<p>
<p>And just so that the player knows where he stands at the end of each turn:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 6 - General Assessment
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An every turn rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if some of the things are concerned, say &quot;You sense some resentment from [the list of concerned things].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the dropped item be a random scalding thing carried by the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can't hang onto so many burning hot things, and lose your grip on [the dropped item].[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try dropping the dropped item.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Finally, we need some rules to decide when the player is, in fact, finished.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 7 - Scoring

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An every turn rule:

<p>

<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;i / take off left shoe / get the glass / put the glass on the platter / get the tile / drop the tile / get the kettle / put the kettle on tile / sit on the blue armchair&quot;.
