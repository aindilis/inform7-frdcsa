Defining phrases in Inform 6</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>The phrases described in this documentation, such as &quot;end the story&quot;, are all defined in the Standard Rules, and are for the most part defined not in terms of other I7 phrases but instead reduced to equivalents in I6. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To end the game in death: (- deadflag=3; story_complete=false; -).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The notation &quot;(-&quot; and &quot;-)&quot; indicates that what comes in between is I6 code. The minus sign is supposed to be a mnemonic for the decrease from 7 to 6: later we shall use &quot;(+&quot; and &quot;+)&quot; to go back up the other way, from 6 to 7.
<p>
<p>When a phrase is defined as containing only a single command, and that command is defined using I6 - as here - it is compiled in-line. This means that the phrase &quot;end the game in death&quot; will always be translated as &quot;deadflag=1;&quot;, rather than being translated into a call to a suitable function whose only statement is &quot;deadflag=1;&quot;.
<p>
<p>This is an easy case since the wording never varies. More typical examples would be:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say (something - number): (- print {something}; -).
<br>To sort (T - table name) in (TC - table column) order:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(- TableSort({T}, {TC}, 1); -).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>When the braced name of one of the variables in the phrase preamble appears, this is compiled to the corresponding I6 expression at the relevant position in the I6 code. So, for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say the capacity of the basket
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>might be compiled to
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">print O17_basket.capacity;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because &quot;{something}&quot; is expanded to &quot;capacity of the basket&quot; (I7 code) and then translated to &quot;O17_basket.capacity&quot; (I6 code), which is then spliced into the original I6 definition &quot;print {something};&quot;.
<p>
<p>Braces &quot;{&quot; are of course significant in I6. A real brace can be obtained by making the character following it a space, and then I7 will not attempt to read it as a request for substitution.
<p>
<p>Finally, note that while a normal I7 phrase definition can give a kind as what must be matched, e.g.,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To release wild tigers into (arena - a room): ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>it is in general a bad idea, and will result in inefficient code, for an phrase defined using I6 to do this. Instead, if possible, match against &quot;object&quot;, where any room, region, thing or direction will be a valid match:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To release wild tigers into (arena - an object): ...
</font></blockquote><p>

<a name="e271"><a href=doc431.html#e271 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 440:  Odins</b></a><br>Making [is-are] and [it-they] say tokens that will choose appropriately based on the last object mentioned.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>The faithful reader may recall this example from the previous chapter. It was always a bit flawed, though, because it didn't account very well for the possibility that our game might contain some intrinsically plural items. Here we define a &quot;to say is-are&quot; ability, checking the appropriate either/or property - &quot;plural-named&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Odins&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The House of a Mortal Farmer is a room. &quot;Having two separate rooms, this house testifies to considerable wealth and success at agriculture.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Bedroom is inside from the House.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A chair is a kind of supporter. A chair is always enterable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the House are a table, two chairs, a basket, and a hearth. On the table is a loaf of bread. Some shoes are on the table.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of a thing is usually &quot;You give [the noun] a glance, but [it-they] [is-are] plainly beneath your attention.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The infant is a man in the basket. The description of the infant is &quot;So strong and fat that you wonder whether one of your fellow gods is acquainted with the mistress of the house-- but it's no concern of yours, of course.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The last mentioned thing is a thing that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the name of something (called the target):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the last mentioned thing is the target.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say is-are:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the last mentioned thing is plural-named, say &quot;are&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;is&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say it-they:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the last mentioned thing is plural-named, say &quot;they&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;it&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x chair / x basket / x infant / x shoes&quot;.
