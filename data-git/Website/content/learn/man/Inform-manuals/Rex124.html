<p>
<p>Since we prefer not to simulate burnt skin, and it is unsporting to kill a player outright merely for touching a hot object, heat is mostly used as a reason why something cannot be picked up at a given moment. This very basic puzzle is demonstrated in <b>Grilling</b>.
<p>
<p>With the naked eye, it is not always easy to detect what is too hot to touch - a point made in both <b>Masochism Deli</b>, where the only solution is to keep picking up potatoes until one doesn't burn, and in <b>Hot Glass Looks Like Cold Glass</b>, where infrared goggles turn the scales.
<p>
<p>If a hot object is not to be touched, will it stay hot forever? It might well, if it is a steak on an electric grill, but not if it is a recently-baked apple pie sitting on a window-sill. <b>Entropy</b> simulates the gradual return of temperature to equilibrium.
