<p>IF is difficult to play: often harder than the writer ever suspects. Players are held up by what is &quot;obvious&quot;, and they stumble into unforeseen combinations, or spend inordinate amounts of time working on the &quot;wrong&quot; problems. Too much of this and they give up, or post questions on online forums. Against this, many IF authors like to include in-game hints.
<p>
<p>There are many approaches, which differ on two main issues.
<p>
<p>First: do we spontaneously offer help to the player? The difficulty here is detecting the player's need: <b>Y ask Y?</b> tries to spot aimlessness, while <b>Solitude</b> has a novice mode where it is reasonable to assume that help is almost always needed. On the other hand, suppose we require that the initiative come from the player. Will a novice know to type HELP? <b>Responding to questions starting with WHO, WHAT, etc.</b> shows how to redirect any attempt to ask a direct question into a HELP request. At the other end of the scale, wearily experienced players may type HELP all the time, out of habit, cheating themselves of the fun of frustration: if so, <b>Real Adventurers Need No Help</b> provides the nicotine patch against this addiction.
<p>
<p>Second: how do we decide what help is needed? Normally the player only types HELP, which is unspecific. The simplest approach offers a menu, diagnosing the player's problem by obliging him to make choices: see <b>Food Network Interactive</b>. Listing all the possible problems in the game may give away too much, though, since players may not have reached the puzzles in question yet; so some authors prefer to create menus that adapt to the current state of the game (commonly called &quot;adaptive hints&quot;). None of the examples demonstrate this variation because it can be a bit long-winded to set up, but several adaptive hint extensions are available for Inform.
<p>
<p>Failing this, we can also try to parse commands like HELP ABOUT MICRODOT, as in <b>Ish.</b> <b>Trieste</b> takes a similar tack, except that instead of offering hints about puzzles, it offers help on game features (such as how to save), and lists all the available topics if the player types simply HELP.
<p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most stylishly, we can try to deduce what the player is stuck on from his immediate circumstances and from what is not yet solved: this needs a powerful adaptive hints system like the one in <b>The Unexamined Life</b>.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we'd like to watch for signs that the player is floundering, and if we see them, recommend that he try the hints. There are probably more sophisticated diagnostics, but as a first cut, let's assume that a player who repeatedly reviews descriptions of objects he's already seen, looks around the room, and takes inventory, is at a loss for more productive activities. So then...
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Y ask Y?&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be examined or unexamined. A thing is usually unexamined. Carry out examining something: now the noun is examined.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Taking inventory is acting confused. Looking is acting confused. Examining an examined thing is acting confused.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After acting confused for the sixth turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(If you are feeling lost, try typing HELP for suggestions.)&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now we write a scenario which will, alas, rather encourage even a deft and clueful player to play as though he were hopelessly confused:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The story headline is &quot;or: Bad Author, No Biscuit&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of a thing is usually &quot;Hm. [The item described] reminds you quite a lot of [a random visible thing which is not the item described].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Yurt is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Food is a kind of thing. Food is always edible. In the Yurt are a yam and a dish of yakitori. The yam and the yakitori are food. The description of food is &quot;Well, at least it's not [a random edible thing which is not the item described].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Yurt is an animal called a yapok.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player wears a yukata. The player carries a yataghan.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds and something is examined:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Your eye is attracted by some kind of surreptitious movement from [the random examined thing].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise if the player carries something and a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The random thing carried by the player] tries to slip from your grasp.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x yam / x yam / look / x yam / i / look / i / help / quit&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And finally a little dollop of perversity from a later chapter:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check quitting the game:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You're sure? &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if player consents, say &quot;[line break]You were getting close to a breakthrough, you know.[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;help&quot; as a mistake (&quot;You're doing fine! Just keep at what you're doing now.&quot;).
</font></blockquote><p>
