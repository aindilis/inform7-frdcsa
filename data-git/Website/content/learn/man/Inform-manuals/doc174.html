<p>In practice it is not enough to apply &quot;if&quot; to a single phrase alone: we want to give a whole list of phrases to be followed repeatedly, or to be followed only if a condition holds.
<p>
<p>We do this by grouping them together, and there are two ways to do this. One is as follows:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To comment upon (whatever - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is transparent, say &quot;I see right through this!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is an open door:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Oh look, an open door!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is openable, say &quot;But you could always shut it.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here we group two phrases together under the same &quot;if&quot;. Note that the &quot;then&quot; has been replaced by a colon, and that the indentation in the list of phrases shows how they are grouped together. In the example above, the source moves two tabs in from the margin; the maximum allowed is 25.
<p>
<p>Indentation is the convention used in this manual and in the examples, but not everybody likes this Pythonesque syntax. So Inform also recognises a more explicit form, in which the beginning and ending are marked with the words &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To comment upon (whatever - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is transparent, say &quot;I see right through this!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is an open door
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Oh look, an open door!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is openable, say &quot;But you could always shut it.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Pythonesque because it's a style popularised by the programming language Python, named in turn after &quot;Monty Python's Flying Circus&quot;.)
