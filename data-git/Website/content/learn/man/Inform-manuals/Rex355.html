<p>
<p>Inform's division of geography into &quot;rooms&quot; is a good compromise for most purposes. The rooms are cut off from each other by (imaginary or actual) walls, while all of the interior of a given room is regarded as the same place.
<p>
<p>Suppose we want to blur the boundaries between rooms, in an environment where there are no walls: out of doors, for instance?
<p>
<p>The simplest cases involve making something exceptional visible in more than one place. <b>Carnivale</b> features an exceptionally large landmark seen by day; <b>Eddystone</b> an exceptionally bright one by night. <b>Waterworld</b> allows a very distant object (the Sun) to be seen throughout many rooms, but never approached. <b>View of Green Hills</b> gives the player an explicit command for looking through into an adjacent room.
<p>
<p>Three systematic examples then present outdoor landscapes with increasing sophistication. <b>Tiny Garden</b> gives the multiple rooms of an extended lawn descriptions which automatically adapt to say which directions lead into further lawn area. <b>Rock Garden</b> provides a relation, &quot;connected with&quot;, between rooms, allowing items in one to be seen from the other: an attempt to interact with a visible item in a different area of the garden triggers an implicit going action first. <b>Stately Gardens</b> provides a much larger outdoor area, where larger landmarks are visible from further away, and room descriptions are highly adaptive.
<p>
<p>In an outdoor environment, the distinction between a one-move journey and a multiple-move journey is also blurred. <b>Hotel Stechelberg</b> shows a signpost which treats these equally.

<p>This time we're going to assume that the player can see into any room that is on a line of sight within one or two steps of travel.

<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place the obelisk in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The obelisk is so large that it can be seen from every room. If we had a number of such large monuments we might want to write a systematic routine to handle them, but this will do for now.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The room description heading rule is not listed in the carry out looking rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now, we set things up so that the surrounding areas are described automatically as part of the room description:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Building description is a truth state that varies. Building description is false.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After looking when the location is an outdoors room:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let space be the room way from the location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if space is an outdoors room, silently try looking toward space;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obelisk is not in the location and the obelisk is unmentioned:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the way be the best route from location to the Upper Terrace;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the way is a direction, say &quot;[The obelisk] is proudly visible on [the way] horizon. [run paragraph on]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increment the count of sentences;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now building description is false;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say paragraph break.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But perhaps there are a few rooms where we do not wish that to happen, so we'll build in exceptions for those.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After looking in the rose garden:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Otherwise, you are quite cut off.&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After looking in the Ha-ha:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And suppose we want to allow the player to look in any direction:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;look [direction]&quot; or &quot;look to/toward [direction]&quot; as facing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Facing is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out facing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the viewed item be the room noun from the location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the viewed item is not a room:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location is indoors, say &quot;Your view is restricted by the lack of doors or windows in that direction.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;You can't see anything promising that way.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try looking toward the viewed item.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of facing up:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Above you is bright sky.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We also need to tell distant rooms how to describe themselves.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;look toward [any adjacent room]&quot; as looking toward.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Looking toward is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check looking toward a room which does not contain something mentionable:

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out looking toward:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the chosen direction is the best route from the location to the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the second noun is the room the chosen direction from the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun contains something mentionable:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through mentionable things in the noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carry out the writing a distant paragraph about activity with the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun contains something mentionable:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increment the count of sentences;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose row count of sentences in the Table of Distance Sentences;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is an outdoors room and the second noun contains something mentionable, say &quot;[both entry] [run paragraph on]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;[here entry] [run paragraph on]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[there entry] [run paragraph on]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And again, some exception needs to be made for seeing what's in the dip in the ground:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of looking toward the Ha-ha:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the chosen direction is the best route from the location to the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the second noun is the room the chosen direction from the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is an outdoors room and the second noun contains something mentionable:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increment the count of sentences;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose row count of sentences in the Table of Distance Sentences;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[there entry] [run paragraph on]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The following is to account for cases where the player types &quot;look toward obelisk&quot; or similar, rather than looking toward a room:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;look toward [something]&quot; as examining.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The following is arguably an unnecessary refinement, but the listing of items in the distance gets a bit repetitive unless we vary the sentence structure.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Chosen direction is a direction that varies.
