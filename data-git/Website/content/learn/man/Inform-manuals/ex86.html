<p>
<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> When reading a command from the keyboard.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> Print the prompt text; wait for the player to type something and press return. Reject an entirely blank line, and treat a command beginning &quot;oops&quot; as a correction to the previous one. This is a fairly complicated business, so it is probably best not to change the &quot;for&quot; rules for this activity: &quot;before&quot;, and especially &quot;after&quot;, are another matter. (Note, however, that if Inform does reject a blank line and ask for another then this all happens inside the &quot;for&quot; rules: no &quot;after&quot; occurs after the blank line, nor does a &quot;before&quot; happen before the second attempt by the player. It is all a single round of the activity, not two.)
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) To lead absolute beginners in gently:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before reading a command while the turn count is 1, say &quot;(This is your chance to say what the protagonist should do next. After the '>', try typing 'take inventory'.)&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(b) The following responds politely but firmly if the player tries to type &quot;please look&quot;, say, instead of just &quot;look&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command includes &quot;please&quot;:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Please do not say please.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reject the player's command.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To explain. Fragments of what the player has typed are called snippets: &quot;the player's command&quot; is the entire thing. We can test if a snippet matches a given pattern like so:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><i>if</i> <b></b>(snippet)<b> matches </b>(topic)<b></b><i>:</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_snippetmatches -->

<p>This condition is true if the given snippet exactly matches the specification. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the player's command matches &quot;room [number]&quot;, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will be true if the command is ROOM 101, but not if it's EXPLORE ROOM 7.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><i>if</i> <b></b>(snippet)<b> does not match </b>(topic)<b></b><i>:</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_snippetdoesnotmatch -->

<p>This condition is true if the given snippet does not exactly match the specification.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><i>if</i> <b></b>(snippet)<b> includes </b>(topic)<b></b><i>:</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_snippetincludes -->

<p>This condition is true if the given snippet includes words matching the specification, either at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the player's command includes &quot;room [number]&quot;, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will be true if the command is ROOM 101, EXPLORE ROOM 7, or ROOM 22 AHOY, but not if it's VISIT ROOM GAMMA 7.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><i>if</i> <b></b>(snippet)<b> does not include </b>(topic)<b></b><i>:</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_snippetdoesnotinclude -->

<p>This condition is true if the given snippet does not include any run of words which matches the specification.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>Lastly, we took drastic action with another new phrase:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>reject the player's command</b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_rejectcommand -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in rules for the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity. It tells Inform not to bother analysing the text further, but to go back to the keyboard. (No time passes; no turn elapses; nothing happens in the simulated world.)
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>(c) An improved version takes commands like &quot;please drop the coin&quot; and strips &quot;please&quot; from them, but then allows them to proceed normally:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command includes &quot;please&quot;:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(Quelle politesse! But no need to say please.)&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cut the matched text.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Matched text&quot; is a snippet containing the words which matched against the pattern in the most recent &quot;includes&quot; condition, so in this case it contains just the single word &quot;please&quot;. Two phrases allow snippets to be altered:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>replace </b>(snippet)<b> with </b>(text)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_replacesnippet -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in &quot;after&quot; rules for the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity; it replaces the snippet of command, usually the &quot;matched text&quot; found immediately before, with the given text. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the player's command includes &quot;room [number]&quot;:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replace the matched text with &quot;office&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>cut </b>(snippet)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_cutsnippet -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in &quot;after&quot; rules for the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity; it replaces the snippet of command, usually the &quot;matched text&quot; found immediately before, with the given text. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the player's command includes &quot;or else&quot;:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cut the matched text.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>Note that &quot;replace&quot; and &quot;cut&quot; can only be used in &quot;after reading a command&quot; rules: not when an action has been chosen and has gone ahead into its rulebooks. Once the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity has finished, the command is final.
<p>
<p>(d) To make the word &quot;grab&quot; an abbreviation for &quot;take all&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command matches &quot;grab&quot;, replace the player's command with &quot;take all&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(&quot;Snippet&quot; is actually a kind of value, so we could say &quot;Ah, you typed '[the player's command]'!&quot; or some such if we liked. But in practice only three snippets are likely to be useful: the two mentioned above, &quot;player's command&quot; and &quot;matched text&quot;, and the &quot;topic understood&quot;, used when matching the &quot;[text]&quot; token in command grammar.)
<p>
<p>(e) Finally, we can make still more detailed alterations to the text of the command using the techniques for indexed text presented in the Advanced Text chapter. For instance:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>change the text of the player's command to </b>(indexed text)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_changecommand -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in &quot;after&quot; rules for the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity; it replaces the current command text entirely. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let T be indexed text;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let T be the player's command;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replace the regular expression &quot;\p&quot; in T with &quot;&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the text of the player's command to T.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This converts the player's command to indexed text, which is then manipulated by searching for any punctuation mark and replacing it with blank text (that is, deleted), and then put back again as the new command.

<a name="e86"><a href=doc312.html#e86 STYLE="text-decoration: none">**<b><b>Example</b> 361:  Cloves</b></a><br>Accepting adverbs anywhere in a command, registering what the player typed but then cutting them out before interpreting the command.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>It has sometimes been suggested that IF should allow for the player to use adverbs, so that doing something &quot;carefully&quot; will have a different effect from doing it &quot;quickly&quot;. There are several inherent challenges here: it's a good idea to make very sure the player knows all his adverb options, and the list of possibilities should probably not be too long.
<p>
<p>Another trick is that adverbs complicate understanding commands, because they can occur anywhere: one might type >GO WEST CAREFULLY or >CAREFULLY GO WEST, and ideally the game should understand both. After reading a command is the best point to do this sort of thing, because we can find adverbs, interpret them, and remove them from the command stream. So:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Cloves&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Manner is a kind of value. The manners are insouciantly, sheepishly, and defiantly.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we have, automatically, a value called manner understood to be used whenever parsing manners, and we can use this even during the &quot;after reading a command&quot; stage, so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command includes &quot;[manner]&quot;:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cut the matched text;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;But how, my dear boy, how? You simply can't do something without a pose. Thus far you have mastered doing things [list of manners].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reject the player's command.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the left hand status line is &quot;Behaving [manner understood]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the right hand status line is &quot;[location]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the manner understood is insouciantly.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Poseur Club is a room. &quot;Lady Mary is laid out on a sofa, her wrists bandaged importantly[if the manner understood is insouciantly] -- and she looks all the more depressed by your indifference to her state[end if]; Salvatore is at the gaming table, clutching his hair with both hands[if the manner understood is defiantly] -- though he looks up long enough to snarl in response to that expression of yours[end if]; Frackenbush is muttering lines from another of his works in progress, as though poetry has nearly made him mad[if the manner understood is sheepishly]. But he spares you a reassuring smile. He's not a bad fellow, Frackenbush[end if].
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The usual people, in short.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing something other than waiting or looking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Dear. No. That would smack of effort.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting when the manner understood is sheepishly:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You scuff your foot against the ground for a moment, and allow a seemly blush to creep over your cheek. It's quite effective, you are sure, though you can't look up and see how it is going.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting when the manner understood is insouciantly:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Thrusting your hands into your pockets, you whistle a jaunty tune.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">'Do shut up,' says a Melancholy Poseur from over by the window.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting when the manner understood is defiantly:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You raise your chin and give a pointed glance around the room as though to say that you are waiting for someone; you are unembarrassed about waiting for her; you have by no means been stood up; and the first person to comment will receive a poke in the eye.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before looking when the manner understood is sheepishly:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You gaze up from under your brows...&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before looking when the manner understood is defiantly:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You cast a withering gaze over the room.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before looking when the manner understood is insouciantly:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if turn count > 1,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You turn an eye to your surroundings, looking faintly-- just faintly-- amused.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;wait / wait insouciantly / sheepishly look / defiantly look / look insouciantly&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The qualification about turn count is to prevent this before message from occurring when the player first looks around the room (automatically) at the start of play.
<p>
<p>Note that to test this example, one must type INSOUCIANTLY TEST ME, and not simply TEST ME: a poseur's work is never done.
