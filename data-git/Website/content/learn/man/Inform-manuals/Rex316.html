<p>
<p>Writing on something is only one way a player can change its visual appearance. IF authors have long been wary of paint brushes, because a sufficiently motivated player could go through a whole landscape like a graffiti artist with a railway bridge. We want to give the player the illusion of freedom of action, while avoiding a situation where unlimited numbers of different decorations might be needed - that would need a table of potentially unlimited size.
<p>
<p>One approach is to limit the number of items which can be decorated. In <b>Palette</b>, only the canvas can be painted, and each image overlays the last. <b>Early Childhood</b> increases the range to allow a whole kind (&quot;block&quot;) to be painted, and also shows how the changing colours can be used to distinguish between otherwise identical objects.
<p>
<p><b>Brown</b> finds a different way to limit the number of simultaneous decorations: almost anything can have a red sticky label attached, but there is only one red sticky label. (So to decorate a new item, the player must first un-decorate an old one.)

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Shipping Room is a room. The red sticky label is a thing carried by the player. The description of the red sticky label is &quot;It reads: AIRMAIL[if the label is part of something (called the parent)]. It is stuck to [the parent][end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A black crate is in Shipping. The description is &quot;A boring black crate.&quot;  The brown crate is a thing in Shipping. The description is &quot;An ordinary brown crate.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After examining something when the label is part of the noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;A bright red sticky label is attached to [the noun]!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here is the essential point: whenever we ATTACH LABEL TO something, it becomes part of that object.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of tying the red sticky label to something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the red sticky label is part of the second noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You stick [the label] to [the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And of course the label cannot be stuck to itself or to more than one thing at a time.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before tying the label to something when the label is part of something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the label is part of the second noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The label] is already stuck to [the second noun].&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(first freeing the label)[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try taking the label;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the label is part of something, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of tying the red sticky label to the label:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;That would ruin the label entirely.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking the label when the label is part of something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player carries the label;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You peel the label off again.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Much of the rest is just tidying to make sure that the player's commands are redirected into the right syntax.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of tying something to the label:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try tying the label to the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of putting the label on something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try tying the label to the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of inserting the label into something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try tying the label to the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the commands &quot;stick&quot; or &quot;apply&quot; as &quot;tie&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We could have created a new &quot;sticking&quot; action, but to keep the example short we will use the built-in &quot;tying&quot; action instead, and respond to the command &quot;stick&quot; just as if it were &quot;tie&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;peel [something]&quot; or &quot;peel off [something]&quot; as taking.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;i / put label on the black crate / look / x black / x label / get the label / apply label to brown crate / look / x brown / peel off label / stick label to label&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
