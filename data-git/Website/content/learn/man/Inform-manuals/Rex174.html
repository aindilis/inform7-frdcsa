Lighting</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>At any place (room, or inside a container) light is either fully present or fully absent. Inform does not usually try to track intermediate states of lighting, but see <b>The Undertomb 2</b> for a single lantern with varying light levels and <b>Zorn of Zorna</b> for multiple candles that can be lit for cumulative changes to the light level.
<p>
<p>Light can be added to, but not taken away: rooms and things can act as sources of light, by having the &quot;lighted&quot; and &quot;lit&quot; properties respectively, but they cannot be sinks which drain light away. The reason darkness is not a constant hazard in Inform-written games is that rooms always have the &quot;lighted&quot; property unless declared &quot;dark&quot;. (We assume daylight or some always-on electric lighting.) A &quot;dark&quot; room may well still be illuminated if a light source happens to be present:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Deep Crypt is a dark room. The candle lantern is a lit thing in the Deep Crypt.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p><b>Hymenaeus</b> allows us to explicitly refer to torches as &quot;lit&quot; or &quot;unlit&quot;, or (as synonyms) &quot;flaming&quot; or &quot;extinguished&quot;.
<p>
<p>For light produced electrically we might want a wall switch, as in <b>Down Below</b>, or a portable lamp, as in <b>The Dark Ages Revisited</b>.
<p>
<p>The fierce, locally confined light thrown out by a carried lamp has a quality quite unlike weak but ambient daylight, and <b>Reflections</b> exploits this to make a lantern feel more realistic.
<p>
<p>When the player experiences darkness in a location, Inform is usually very guarded in what it reveals. (&quot;It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.&quot;) <b>Hohmann Transfer</b> gives darkness a quite different look, and <b>Four Stars</b> heightens the other senses so that a player in darkness can still detect her surroundings. The first of the two examples in <b>Peeled</b> allows exploration of a dark place by touch.
<p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to check whether a room that is not the current location happens to contain a light source or be naturally lighted. This poses a few challenges. <b>Unblinking</b> demonstrates one way of doing this, so long as there are no backdrop light sources.
<p>
<p><b>Cloak of Darkness</b> is a short and sweet game based on a light puzzle.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we have a situation where the player is in darkness, but is allowed to feel and interact with (except for examining) any large objects. In that case, we write a scope rule that puts those large objects into scope all the time, and trust the &quot;requires light&quot; aspect of verbs like examining to prevent the player from doing any actions that he shouldn't:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Peeled&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be large or small.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before touching a large thing when in darkness: say &quot;You grope for [the noun]...&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through large things in the location:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place item in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Some generic surroundings are backdrop. They are everywhere. Understand &quot;walls&quot; or &quot;wall&quot; or &quot;ceiling&quot; or &quot;ground&quot; or &quot;floor&quot; or &quot;area&quot; or &quot;room&quot; or &quot;here&quot; as the generic surroundings. Instead of touching the generic surroundings: say &quot;You encounter nothing extraordinary.&quot; Instead of touching the generic surroundings when in darkness: say &quot;You try feeling your way around and reach [a list of large things in the location].&quot; After deciding the scope of the player when in darkness: place the surroundings in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Room of Mystery is a dark room. The bearskin rug is a large thing in the Room of Mystery. Instead of touching the rug: say &quot;It feels furry!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The peeled grape is a small thing in the Room of Mystery. Instead of touching the peeled grape: say &quot;Gosh, is that an eyeball?&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;feel floor / feel rug / eat rug / examine rug / get grape&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Sadly, because the grape is small, the player will never encounter this horror.
<p>
<p>Alternatively, suppose we have a situation in which the player can use one command to interact with a kind of thing that isn't normally in scope. It's usually most convenient to write the &quot;understand&quot; rule appropriately rather than use the scope activity.
<p>
<p>(Note that we define &quot;inquiring about&quot; as applying to one *visible* thing; otherwise we would be required to be able to touch the catsuit in order to inquire about it. More on this restriction may be found in the Advanced Actions chapter on the topic of visible, touchable, and carried things.)
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Peeled&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Steed's Flat is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;ask about [any subject]&quot; as inquiring about. A subject is a kind of thing. The skintight catsuit is a subject. Inquiring about is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out inquiring about something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'What can you tell me about [the noun]?' you demand. Mr Steed raises his eyebrows, but does not reply.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;ask about catsuit / x catsuit&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>All this said, there do arise certain complex situations when we want an activity-specific scoping.
