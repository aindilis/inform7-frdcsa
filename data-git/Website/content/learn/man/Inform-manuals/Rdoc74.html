<p>Writing on something is only one way a player can change its visual appearance. IF authors have long been wary of paint brushes, because a sufficiently motivated player could go through a whole landscape like a graffiti artist with a railway bridge. We want to give the player the illusion of freedom of action, while avoiding a situation where unlimited numbers of different decorations might be needed - that would need a table of potentially unlimited size.
<p>
<p>One approach is to limit the number of items which can be decorated. In <b>Palette</b>, only the canvas can be painted, and each image overlays the last. <b>Early Childhood</b> increases the range to allow a whole kind (&quot;block&quot;) to be painted, and also shows how the changing colours can be used to distinguish between otherwise identical objects.
<p>
<p><b>Brown</b> finds a different way to limit the number of simultaneous decorations: almost anything can have a red sticky label attached, but there is only one red sticky label. (So to decorate a new item, the player must first un-decorate an old one.)
