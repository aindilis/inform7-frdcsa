<p>The following looks quite innocent:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say (V - value) twice: say &quot;[V]. [V], I say!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>It's clear at a glance what this is intended to do, but at a second glance things aren't so straightforward. &quot;Value&quot; is not itself a kind - it's too big and unspecific. For instance, if we were to allow a variable to be just &quot;a value&quot;, we could freely set it to 12 one minute and to &quot;dahlias&quot; the next, and such a variable would be dangerous since we would never know what could safely be done with its contents. A phrase like this one is called &quot;generic&quot;, because it's not so much a single, actual phrase as a recipe to make phrases. (Inform automatically works out which kinds we need the phrase for, and creates a version of the phrase for those kinds.)
<p>
<p>So &quot;value&quot; is not a kind, but a kind of kind. Inform has several of these:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">value, arithmetic value, enumerated value, sayable value
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These act as ways to say &quot;a value of any kind matching this can go here&quot;. For example, &quot;value&quot; is a way to say &quot;any kind at all&quot;; &quot;arithmetic value&quot; is any kind which arithmetic can be performed on (any kind with the little calculator icon in the Kinds index); and so on. If we write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To double (V - arithmetic value): say &quot;[V times 2].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>the restriction to &quot;arithmetic value&quot; means that although &quot;double 3&quot;, &quot;double 6 kg&quot;, etc., would be matched, &quot;double the Entire Game&quot; would not - you can't perform arithmetic on scenes. Similarly, it would have been tidier to write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say (V - sayable value) twice: say &quot;[V]. [V], I say!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because then Inform will make it clearer why &quot;say X twice&quot; won't work if X is one of those rare values which it can't say (an activity, for instance).
<p>
<p>The Kinds index shows which kinds match against which of these &quot;kinds of kind&quot;. For instance, it shows that &quot;time&quot;
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Matches: value, arithmetic value, sayable value
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which means that time is something we can do arithmetic on, and can say.
