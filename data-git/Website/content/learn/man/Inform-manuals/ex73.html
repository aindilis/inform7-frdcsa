<p>
<p>Items are ordinarily understood only by their original given names. For instance, if we have:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Herb Garden is a china pot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then the player could refer to this as &quot;pot&quot;, &quot;china pot&quot; or &quot;china&quot;. We can embellish this by adding extra forms:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;chinese pot&quot; or &quot;chinese vase&quot; as the china pot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But suppose the pot changes its nature in the course of play? If we have:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The china pot can be unbroken or broken. The china pot is unbroken.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After dropping the china pot:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Crack!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the china pot is broken;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the printed name of the pot is &quot;broken pot&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So now the player would reasonably expect to call it &quot;broken pot&quot;, a wording which would have been rejected before. We can achieve this by writing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the unbroken property as describing the pot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which allows &quot;unbroken&quot; or &quot;broken&quot; to describe the pot, depending on its state. And, since the player might well use a different adjective but with the same idea in mind, we can even add:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;shattered&quot; or &quot;cracked&quot; or &quot;smashed&quot; as broken. Understand &quot;pristine&quot; as unbroken.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is something of a toy example, but the feature looks rather more useful when there are more pots than just one:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Terracotta&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A flowerpot is a kind of thing. A flowerpot can be unbroken or broken. Understand the broken property as describing a flowerpot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After dropping an unbroken flowerpot:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Crack!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun is broken;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the printed name of the noun is &quot;broken flowerpot&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the printed plural name of the noun is &quot;broken flowerpots&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Herb Garden is a room. In the Herb Garden are ten unbroken flowerpots.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We then have the dialogue:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Herb Garden
<br>You can see ten flowerpots here.
<br>>get two flowerpots
<br>flowerpot: Taken.
<br>flowerpot: Taken.
<br>>drop all
<br>flowerpot: Crack!
<br>flowerpot: Crack!
<br>>look
<br>Herb Garden
<br>You can see two broken flowerpots and eight flowerpots here.
<br>>get an unbroken flowerpot
<br>Taken.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and so on and so forth.
<p>
<p>There are in fact two slightly different forms of this kind of sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the broken property as describing a flowerpot.
<br>Understand the broken property as referring to a flowerpot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The only difference is that in the &quot;describing&quot; case, the property's name alone can mean the thing in question - so &quot;take unbroken&quot; will work; whereas, in the &quot;referring to&quot;, the property's name can only be used as an adjective preceding the name of thing itself - so &quot;take unbroken flowerpot&quot; will work but &quot;take unbroken&quot; will not.

<p>
<p>Our previous implementation of televisions (&quot;Channel 1&quot;) doesn't allow the player to type things like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">TUNE FIFTIES TELEVISION TO CHANNEL 4
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>nor does it deal with player input like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">TUNE TO CHANNEL 4 ON FIFTIES TELEVISION
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>or
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">TUNE TO CHANNEL 4
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>where no television is specified. When we are designing commands which involve two elements (here, a television and a channel number), it's usually a good idea to allow the player to specify those elements in either order, as we saw demonstrated briefly in &quot;New commands for old grammar&quot;.
<p>
<p>We might, therefore, want to add a few refinements: first by defining a &quot;[channel]&quot; token that will accept input of the forms &quot;[number]&quot; and &quot;channel [number]&quot;, and second by creating some additional &quot;Understand&quot; lines that will accept variant versions of the player's input.
