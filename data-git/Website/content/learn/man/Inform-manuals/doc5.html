<p>Replay works identically to Go, except that it does something further: once the game is created, it automatically plays through the same commands as were typed into the previous version. For instance: suppose we click Go to bring Midsummer Day into being, and find ourselves playing the game. We type &quot;look&quot; and find that there is not much to see. Going back to the source, we add
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;A white canvas parasol raised up on stakes driven into the grass.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>so that the source now reads
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Midsummer Day&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Gazebo is a room. &quot;A white canvas parasol raised up on stakes driven into the grass.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Instead of clicking Go, we click Replay, and can sit back and watch what has changed. In this example, it only saves us the trouble of typing &quot;look&quot;, but once games become long and elaborate, Replay is invaluable: and especially when we notice in play that something very minor is wrong - a spelling error, say - and want to fix it immediately, without fuss.
