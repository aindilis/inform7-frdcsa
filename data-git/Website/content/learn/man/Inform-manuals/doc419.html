<p>When any source text is run through Inform, a secret first line is inserted, which reads:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include the Standard Rules by Graham Nelson.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;Standard Rules&quot; file contains the definitions of the basic kinds, phrases, actions and grammar described in this documentation: for instance, it includes lines like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A container is a kind of thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...without which Inform would be lost. Although including the Standard Rules is compulsory, it is treated internally as if it were any other &quot;extension&quot;.
<p>
<p>What happens when an &quot;Include&quot; sentence is reached is that the sentence is replaced with the whole text of the file in question, often many paragraphs long.
<p>
<p>If the file has already been included, then the sentence is simply ignored. This is so that we can have two extensions, each of which needs the other: if A says to include B, and B says to include A, the result is that including one automatically includes the other, so we always get both which ever we ask for - not that there is a hideous infinite regress.
