<p>
<p>Stretching a point seasonally, we might write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn, say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This rule is nameless. It needs no name because it will never need to be referred to: by identifying it as an every turn rule we have already said enough to lodge it in the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook. In fact, though, it is easy to create a named rule:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the blossom shaking rule: say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The name of a rule must always end with the word &quot;rule&quot;, for clarity's sake. (The phrasing &quot;This is the ... rule&quot; is used because &quot;The ... rule&quot; would be open to misinterpretation.)
<p>
<p>Previously we had a rule which had no name, but belonged to a rulebook: now we have the opposite, because although the &quot;blossom shaking rule&quot; has a name, it has not been placed in any rulebook. That means it will probably never be applied, unless we give specific instructions for that.
<p>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible to both name and place a rule in a single sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn (this is the alternative blossom rule): say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now the &quot;alternative blossom rule&quot; is a named rule in the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook.
<p>
<p><hr><p>
<a name="e358"><a href=ex358.html#e358 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b>Example 376:  Stone</b></a><br>A soup to which the player can add ingredients, which will have different effects when the player eats.<p>
<a name="e97"><a href=ex97.html#e97 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b>Example 377: The Crane's Leg 2</b></a><br>A description text generated based on the propensities of the player-character, following different rulebooks for different characters.<p>
<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e170"><a href=doc323.html#e170 STYLE="text-decoration: none">**<b><b>Example</b> 378:  Bribery</b></a><br>A GIVE command that gets rid of Inform's default refusal message in favor of something a bit more sophisticated.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>If we want to rewrite the functionality of a command that usually ends with a &quot;block...&quot; rule, we will have to begin by turning the blocking off.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Bribery&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The block giving rule is not listed in the check giving it to rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As it happens, correct behavior is built into the GIVE command once &quot;block giving&quot; is turned off, so we do not have to write a replacement report or carry-out rule; the object will be transferred to the possession of the caterpillar. But we do want to adjust the action just a little so that our gift cheers up the recipient:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out giving (this is the gratitude for gifts rule): improve the mood of the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mood is a kind of value. The moods are hostile, suspicious, indifferent, friendly, and adoring. An animal has a mood. An animal is usually indifferent.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To improve the mood of (character - an animal):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the mood of character is less than friendly, now the mood of the character is the mood after the mood of the character.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now whenever we give something to an animal, the animal will be pleased about the present. Of course, we might also want to add a check rule to giving, to see whether the offering is something the recipient really wants:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check giving (this is the polite refusal of unwanted objects rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless the noun interests the second noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The second noun] disdainfully refuses [the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide whether (item - a thing) interests (character - a person):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the character has the item, no;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the item is edible, yes;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of showing something to someone:
<br>try giving the noun to the second noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There is already a perfectly workable report rule that will describe what happens when we give something to someone, but let's say we want to report on the recipient's changed mood, too:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After giving something to someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You give [the noun] to [the second noun], who appears mollified and is now merely [mood of the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And the rest is all scenario:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Leafy Branch is a room. &quot;You stand on smooth bark dappled by sunlight. The scent-trail runs forward to home.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The branch continues forward and backward from here, and a stem extends forward-up.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going south in Leafy Branch, say &quot;You must not back down! The scent trail leads onward!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a hostile animal in the Leafy Branch. &quot;[The Caterpillar] looks [mood].&quot; Instead of examining the Caterpillar, say &quot;[The caterpillar] appears [mood].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries an edible thing called a peanut crumb. The carrying capacity of the player is 1. After taking something, say &quot;You lift [the noun], though it is nearly your own size.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going north in the presence of a hostile caterpillar:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The Caterpillar] moves to block your exit, glaring down at you with all the bristles on its skin extended to full size.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going north in the presence of a suspicious caterpillar:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The Caterpillar] moves to block your exit, though it might allow you past if you offered further tribute.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Leaf Face is above the branch. &quot;The smooth and shiny surface of the leaf extends forward from here, but you have lost the scent-trail. This is not the way home.&quot;  The pear fragment is an edible thing in Leaf Face. The dead aphid is a thing in Leaf Face.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Twig is north of Leafy Branch. &quot;The scent-trail is weak but not entirely gone, and you pursue it faithfully...&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After going to the Twig:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The scent-trail is weak but not entirely gone, and you pursue it faithfully...&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the story finally.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;forward-up&quot; as up. Understand &quot;forward&quot; as north. Understand &quot;backward&quot; as south.  Understand &quot;backward-down&quot; as down.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;forward / give crumb to caterpillar / forward / forward-up / get aphid / get fragment / down / give aphid to caterpillar / drop aphid / forward-up / get fragment / down / give fragment / forward&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
