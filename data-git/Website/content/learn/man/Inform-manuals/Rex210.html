<p>
<p>Not all characters are friendly, and there are times when we may want to include a fight sequence. There are a number of ways to approach this, depending on whether we want to offer the player a random outcome, a predetermined one, or a combat sequence that depends partly on strategy or on having the proper equipment.
<p>
<p><b>Lanista 1</b> demonstrates randomized combat in the style of a role-playing game. The player has a partially random chance of doing any given amount of damage; both the player and his opponent have hit points, and whichever one runs out first dies. <b>Lanista 2</b> continues this idea, but includes weapons that affect the amount of of damage done. <b>Red Cross</b> by itself implements a command that we might use to find out how strong characters are at the moment.
<p>
<p>A word of warning about designing such sequences: a player who gets a roll he doesn't like always has the option of UNDOing a turn and re-rolling. This means that he can always win a random battle sooner or later; bad luck only means that it takes him longer (so he gets more bored and irritated as he plays through). It is possible to turn off UNDO implementation with
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use UNDO prevention.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...but there is a good chance that this will irritate players in itself. Role-playing-style combat scenarios need careful design, lest they actively make a game less fun.
<p>
<p>In a slightly more realistic setting, combat leaves physical remains behind, unless we're wielding some kind of futuristic weapon that evaporates our opponents entirely: <b>Puff of Orange Smoke</b> demonstrates characters who leave corpses behind when they die, while <b>Technological Terror</b> more tamely explodes robots into numerous component parts.
<p>
<p>Finally, we can imagine some scenarios in which, instead of allowing characters to strike at each other for random damage, we want to introduce an element of strategy. <b>Don Pedro's Revenge</b> shows the rudiments of a system in which the characters can make different kinds of attack depending on where they are in a room filled with perches, barrels, and other swashbuckler props.

<a name="e210"><a href=Rdoc51.html#e210 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 130: Lanista 1</b></a><br>Very simple randomized combat in which characters hit one another for a randomized amount of damage.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Lanista, Part One&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Arena is a room. &quot;Sand, blood, iron. These festivals are normally held on hot days, but the sun has gone behind a cloud and fat drops of rain now and then spatter the arena floor.&quot; The gladiator is a man in the Arena. &quot;A bare-chested Scythian gladiator faces you, wielding a trident.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We start by recording, for each person, a maximum number of points of damage the person can sustain when starting from health, and the current number of points remaining. In the tradition of role-playing games, these are referred to as hit points.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person has a number called maximum hit points. A person has a number called current hit points.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The maximum hit points of the player is 35. The maximum hit points of the gladiator is 25.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The current hit points of the player is 35. The current hit points of the gladiator is 25.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now our rule for the actual attack. We want first to calculate how much damage the player's attack does, inflict that damage, and remove the enemy if he's dead; then, if he doesn't die, the enemy counter-attacks, also for a randomized amount of damage, and if this kills the player, the game ends in defeat.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of attacking someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the damage be a random number between 2 and 10;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You attack [the noun], causing [damage] points of damage!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decrease the current hit points of the noun by the damage;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the current hit points of the noun is less than 0:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[line break][The noun] expires, and is immediately carried away by the Arena slaves!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the noun from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the story finally;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stop the action;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the enemy damage be a random number between 2 and 10;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[line break][The noun] attacks you, causing [enemy damage] points of damage!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decrease the current hit points of the player by the enemy damage;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the current hit points of the player is less than 0:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[line break]You expire!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the story.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This last bit is a refinement to help the player keep track of how the contest is going:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the left hand status line is &quot;You: [current hit points of player]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the right hand status line is &quot;Gladiator: [current hit points of gladiator]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;hit gladiator / g / g / g&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
