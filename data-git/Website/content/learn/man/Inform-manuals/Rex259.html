<p>
<p>IF is difficult to play: often harder than the writer ever suspects. Players are held up by what is &quot;obvious&quot;, and they stumble into unforeseen combinations, or spend inordinate amounts of time working on the &quot;wrong&quot; problems. Too much of this and they give up, or post questions on online forums. Against this, many IF authors like to include in-game hints.
<p>
<p>There are many approaches, which differ on two main issues.
<p>
<p>First: do we spontaneously offer help to the player? The difficulty here is detecting the player's need: <b>Y ask Y?</b> tries to spot aimlessness, while <b>Solitude</b> has a novice mode where it is reasonable to assume that help is almost always needed. On the other hand, suppose we require that the initiative come from the player. Will a novice know to type HELP? <b>Responding to questions starting with WHO, WHAT, etc.</b> shows how to redirect any attempt to ask a direct question into a HELP request. At the other end of the scale, wearily experienced players may type HELP all the time, out of habit, cheating themselves of the fun of frustration: if so, <b>Real Adventurers Need No Help</b> provides the nicotine patch against this addiction.
<p>
<p>Second: how do we decide what help is needed? Normally the player only types HELP, which is unspecific. The simplest approach offers a menu, diagnosing the player's problem by obliging him to make choices: see <b>Food Network Interactive</b>. Listing all the possible problems in the game may give away too much, though, since players may not have reached the puzzles in question yet; so some authors prefer to create menus that adapt to the current state of the game (commonly called &quot;adaptive hints&quot;). None of the examples demonstrate this variation because it can be a bit long-winded to set up, but several adaptive hint extensions are available for Inform.
<p>
<p>Failing this, we can also try to parse commands like HELP ABOUT MICRODOT, as in <b>Ish.</b> <b>Trieste</b> takes a similar tack, except that instead of offering hints about puzzles, it offers help on game features (such as how to save), and lists all the available topics if the player types simply HELP.
<p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most stylishly, we can try to deduce what the player is stuck on from his immediate circumstances and from what is not yet solved: this needs a powerful adaptive hints system like the one in <b>The Unexamined Life</b>.

<p>Observation of novice IF players suggests that they often have a hard time figuring out how to get started, especially if they are encountering the game in a context where they don't have time to settle in and read instructions. Here we provide some training wheels to help them learn to communicate.
<p>
<p>This is divided into several parts. The first part is the system of rules for general guidance, which could be excerpted and used anywhere. The second part is a scenario using these rules.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Solitude&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Part 1 - General Rules
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Have you played interactive fiction before? >&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now novice mode is whether or not the player consents.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The rationale for asking the question this way, and not another, is that novices asked whether they would like instructions very often say no, even if they need them.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Novice mode is a truth state that varies. Novice mode is true.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Stopping novice mode is an action out of world.
<br>Starting novice mode is an action out of world.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;novice mode off&quot; or &quot;novice off&quot; as stopping novice mode.
<br>Understand &quot;novice mode on&quot; or &quot;novice on&quot; as starting novice mode.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out stopping novice mode: now novice mode is false.
<br>Carry out starting novice mode: now novice mode is true.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report stopping novice mode: say &quot;Novice mode is now off.&quot;
<br>Report starting novice mode: say &quot;Novice mode is now on.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before reading a command when novice mode is true:

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The suggestion about asking for help is no good unless we provide some. This might take any of a number of forms, but for the sake of example we'll use an easy way out:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short. Include Menus by Emily Short. Include Basic Help Menu by Emily Short.
