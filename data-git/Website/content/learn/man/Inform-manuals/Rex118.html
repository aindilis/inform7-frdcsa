<p>
<p>This section covers vehicles whose interior consists of at least one entire room. Moving into this room constitutes boarding: there is then some pause while it travels: moving out again disembarks at a different location. The only complication arising is how the player controls the journey (by talking to someone? by pressing buttons? by steering?).
<p>
<p><b>The Unbuttoned Elevator Affair</b> provides the simplest possible whole-room vehicle, which ferries between two fixed points. If you are at one of these, it must be the other one you want to get to, so there is no need for controls.
<p>
<p><b>Dubai</b> is a much more elaborate elevator, with many possible destinations, chosen using buttons inside the elevator.
<p>
<p><b>Empire</b> simulates a train journey. Here there are no controls as such, but the train passes through a sequence of stops spaced apart in time, so the player chooses an exit by getting out at the right moment.
<p>
<p>On a very large, slowish craft such as a cruise liner, we are not so much travelling in a vehicle: it's more as if we are visiting a whole building, which becomes our world for the (probably long) duration of the journey. The liner steers around in long, slow curves, changing its orientation in the water, so that (if we think of &quot;north&quot; as a strictly magnetic matter, anyway) north is constantly rotating: something we don't notice on board because our own reference points, provided by the ship itself, stay fixed relative to ourselves. Because of this, some ships in IF are navigated using FORE, AFT, PORT and STARBOARD directions rather than NORTH, EAST, SOUTH and WEST: see <b>Fore</b>.

<p>
<p>The problem of implementing an elevator that opens onto a large number of floors often challenges novice interactive fiction authors. It also raises a fundamental design problem -- how to implement a large building in an interesting way. It is tempting to write a hotel with an elevator and innumerable tedious and identical floors just for the sake of realism; in many cases it is a better idea simply to omit any locations that contribute nothing to the story or the play of the game.
<p>
<p>In charity, though, let us assume that the author has a legitimate reason for wanting to implement an elevator that opens onto some generic floors. We will go whole-hog, and set this in the world's tallest hotel: Burj al-Arab, Dubai.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Dubai&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Burj al-Arab Lobby is a room. &quot;The 202-suite Burj al-Arab - or Tower of the Arabs - stands 321 metres (1,060 feet) high, and floats on its own man-made island. It is shaped like the sail of a boat; just crossing the private bridge to reach this place set you back $55.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Since our budget did not run to visiting Burj al-Arab, the descriptions place implicit faith in the hotel's website.)
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Assawan Spa is a room. &quot;Treatment rooms, hydrotherapy baths, oriental massage, stand-up solarium, sauna, steam rooms and jacuzzi, two swimming pools, squash court, two fully equipped fitness studios and an aerobics floor. To the south is a shopping area, for those who do not find exercise adequately therapeutic.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Shopping Area is south of Assawan Spa. &quot;In a setting that would make a poet sigh, you may enjoy the services of (among others) Bulgari, Black Pearl Caviar, Albarajeel Carpet Shop, Abdul Samed Al Qurashi (amber and Arabic perfumes), Dianoor (jewellery), and the Commercial Bank of Dubai.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Al Falak Ballroom is a room. &quot;A palatial, two-tiered, domed ballroom crowned with a unique crystal chandelier.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Sahn Eddar is a room. &quot;At the base of the world's tallest atrium, the Sahn Eddar restaurant offers light fine fare and Afternoon Tea. At the center, a 32-meter water column leaps toward the roof of the atrium.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Al Mahara is a room. &quot;After the elevator, you must take a three-minute virtual submarine voyage to reach this seafood restaurant. A magnificent oval aquarium, full of sharks, is visible from every table.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Al Iwan is a room. &quot;Middle-eastern food in an environment of dramatic black, red, and gold.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Al Muntaha is a room. &quot;A top-floor restaurant with a magnificent view: the name means the ultimate or the highest, suitable for a place that stands at 200 metres above the Arabian Gulf. It offers modern European cuisine; and just off to the south is the Skyview Bar.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Skyview Bar is south of Al Muntaha. &quot;'A wonderful location for pre- and post dinner drinks,' claims the hotel's brochure, and certainly you can't fault the view.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Juna Lounge is a room. &quot;Two humidors that offer one of the largest selections of the finest Havana cigars in Dubai.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Lift is a room. &quot;This is not a mere elevator: it is an express panoramic lift, traveling six meters a second, and capable of taking you from lobby to the rooftop restaurant in an astonishingly short time. The illuminated number above the door says [current level of the Lift] - though you can make it move by pressing a numbered button.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Presidential Suite is a room. &quot;Astonishingly, this is not the most elaborate or expensive of suites; there is another, the Royal, upstairs of here.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Royal Suite is a room. &quot;The brochure described this as 'the last word in luxury,' and you have to admit that it is certainly the last word in [italic type]something[roman type]. A vast carpet of patterned red and gold stretches from you to the sofa; beyond which, in the distance, you make out several bedrooms and bathrooms outfitted in Carrera marble. There is also, of course, a private cinema.&quot;

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;press 3 / in / press button 3 / look / out / in / press 27 / out / s / in / n / in / press 15 / out / in / press 18 / out / s / in / n / in / press 4 button / out&quot;.

<p>
<p>This will all work very well, unless the player has portable objects; in that case, anything he drops on the Generic Floor will be there every time he goes back -- whether it's masquerading as Floor 6 or Floor 23. There are there are two ways round this -- (i) the cheeky way. When we drop something, the unobtrusive yet ever-vigilant maids pick it up and take it down to the Foyer's lost property office; and (ii) the super-duper way, in which things are moved out of play but with their floor numbers remembered, so that the scenario can be reconstructed each time. (i) is probably in fact the more true-to-life, considering the hotel's boasts about its service, but we will demonstrate both methods.
<p>
<p>Here is the version with vigilant maids:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a shopping bag. In the bag are a diamond necklace, a small rug, and a jar of caviar.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out pressing button:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every portable thing enclosed by the Generic Floor is in the Office.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Office is south of the Lobby. &quot;Here the maids collect everything abandoned by careless guests.&quot; The printed name of the Office is &quot;Lost and Found Office&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test maids with &quot;in / press 6 / out / drop all / in / out / in / press 23 / out / in / press 1 / out / s / get all&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Notice that we tie the maid service to the pressing of the lift button, so that if the player just goes into the lift and comes out again, the maids will not have had a chance to clear his possessions.
<p>
<p>Alternatively:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a shopping bag. In the bag are an evening gown, a bolero jacket, and tickets to the Wild Wadi Animal Park.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out pressing button when something is in the Generic Floor:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through portable things in the Generic Floor:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through portable things enclosed by the Generic Floor:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear the item.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;enclosed by&quot; line clears even things left on, say, small un-portable side-tables or whatever; but because we do &quot;in&quot; first, we make sure to move any containers or supporters undisturbed. The next bit could be more tidily incorporated into our previous &quot;before going outside&quot; rule, but since we are writing this code to be optionally pasted onto the end of the first bit, we'll express the rule separately:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before going outside in the Lift when something is in Limbo:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless there is a floor corresponding to a level of the current level of the Lift in the Table of Floors:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through things in Limbo:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the current level of the item is the current level of the Lift, move the item to the Generic Floor.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing has a number called current level.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To clear (item - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the current level of the item is the current level of the Lift;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move item to Limbo.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Limbo is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test management with &quot;get all from bag / in / press 22 / out / drop tickets / in / press 23 / out / drop gown / in / press 22 / out / get tickets / in / press 23 / out / get gown&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now we have a situation in which the player's valuables are left untouched wherever in the hotel he happens to abandon them.
<p>
<p>Incidentally, this example was almost set in an entirely different location: the largest hotel in the world would be the Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang, North Korea, with its 105 floors -- if construction had ever progressed beyond the creation of the building's huge concrete shell.
