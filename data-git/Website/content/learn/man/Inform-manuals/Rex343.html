<p>
<p>Inform's division of geography into &quot;rooms&quot; is a good compromise for most purposes. The rooms are cut off from each other by (imaginary or actual) walls, while all of the interior of a given room is regarded as the same place.
<p>
<p>Suppose we want to blur the boundaries between rooms, in an environment where there are no walls: out of doors, for instance?
<p>
<p>The simplest cases involve making something exceptional visible in more than one place. <b>Carnivale</b> features an exceptionally large landmark seen by day; <b>Eddystone</b> an exceptionally bright one by night. <b>Waterworld</b> allows a very distant object (the Sun) to be seen throughout many rooms, but never approached. <b>View of Green Hills</b> gives the player an explicit command for looking through into an adjacent room.
<p>
<p>Three systematic examples then present outdoor landscapes with increasing sophistication. <b>Tiny Garden</b> gives the multiple rooms of an extended lawn descriptions which automatically adapt to say which directions lead into further lawn area. <b>Rock Garden</b> provides a relation, &quot;connected with&quot;, between rooms, allowing items in one to be seen from the other: an attempt to interact with a visible item in a different area of the garden triggers an implicit going action first. <b>Stately Gardens</b> provides a much larger outdoor area, where larger landmarks are visible from further away, and room descriptions are highly adaptive.
<p>
<p>In an outdoor environment, the distinction between a one-move journey and a multiple-move journey is also blurred. <b>Hotel Stechelberg</b> shows a signpost which treats these equally.

<p>The following rule appends a paragraph to every room description. We need not worry about doors (despite the pass in the Bernese Oberland known figuratively as the &quot;Little Door&quot;).
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Hotel Stechelberg&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After looking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Yellow arms on the signpost point:-[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with destination running through interesting rooms:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the way be the best route from the location to the destination;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the way is a direction, say &quot;  [way] for [the destination]: [number of moves from the location to the destination] Std.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Hotel Stechelberg is a room. &quot;The wooden hiking inn at the end of the road, with flowerboxes, canton flags, outdoor tables and a triangular paddock for the cows contesting the annual Miss Stechelberg competition.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A room can be dull or interesting. A room is usually dull.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">North of Hotel Stechelberg is Trummelbachfalle. North of Trummelbachfalle is Lauterbrunnen. Lauterbrunnen is interesting.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>

<p>With a bit more work, the result might be:
