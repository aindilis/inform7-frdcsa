<p>Inform has altogether five mutually exclusive ways in which one thing can be physically joined to another one:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">containment relation - The coin is in the purse.
<br>support relation - The coin is on the table.
<br>incorporation relation - The coin is part of the sculpture.
<br>carrying relation - The coin is carried by Peter.
<br>wearing relation - The jacket is worn by Peter.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is why we cannot have
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The coin is on the table.
<br>The coin is part of the table.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>simultaneously, and it is a rare exception to the general rule that having one relation does not affect having another.
<p>
<p>But there is also a sixth relation used in Inform for these meanings: the possession relation, which is the meaning of the verb &quot;to have&quot;. At first sight this looks the same as the carrying relation, but in fact it is a convenient shorthand for &quot;carrying or wearing&quot;, provided for conditions rather than assertions:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if Mr Darcy has a wet shirt ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will be true during play if he is either carrying or wearing the shirt.
<p>
<p>Still another relation exists which can be tested, but not declared to be true or false: the concealment relation, which is the meaning of the verb &quot;to conceal&quot;. So we can ask:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if Mr Darcy conceals a fob watch ...
</font></blockquote><p>

<a name="e70"><a href=doc211.html#e70 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 225:  Celadon</b></a><br>Using the enclosure relation to let the player drop things which he only indirectly carries.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>By default, Inform only lets the player drop those things which he is carrying -- that is, those directly in his possession. Things inside satchels or on portable trays have to be taken first.
<p>
<p>If we want to change this behavior, we might add a dropping rule that distinguishes between carrying and mere enclosure (introduced back in &quot;The location of something&quot; in the chapter on Things):
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;Celadon&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Tea Room is a room. The player carries a black lacquer tray. The lacquer tray is portable. On the lacquer tray are a celadon teapot and a napkin.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before dropping something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player does not carry the noun and the player encloses the noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(first taking [the noun] from [the holder of the noun])&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try taking the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player does not carry the noun, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking the napkin:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;It seems to be stuck to the tray, possibly by an underlying wad of gum.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;i / drop teapot / i / look / drop teapot / drop napkin / i / drop tray&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
</td></tr></table><p>
