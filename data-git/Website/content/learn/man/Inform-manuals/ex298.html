Assemblies and body parts</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>In the previous chapter, we saw that it was possible to make sub-parts of things. For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The white door is in the Drawing Room. The handle is part of the white door.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>creates a door with an attached handle. But what if we want to say that not just this door, but every door, should have a handle? To do this we first need to create a kind called &quot;handle&quot;, since there will clearly need to be many handles. The solution is:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A handle is a kind of thing. A handle is part of every door.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Every&quot; is a loaded word and best used sparingly. A sentence like &quot;A handle is part of every handle&quot; would, if taken literally, mean that a handle takes forever to make and is never finished. Inform will reject this, but the moral is clear: we should think about what we are doing with &quot;every&quot;.
<p>
<p>We will usually want to work with smaller collections - not literally every room, but with a whole set of them all the same. We can do that like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A silver coin is a kind of thing. A banking room is a kind of room. Five silver coins are in every banking room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The effect of sentences like these is to make what we might call &quot;assemblies&quot; instead of single things. When a banking room is created, so are five more silver coins; when a door is created, so is another handle. Such sentences act not only on items created later on in the source text, but also on all those created so far.
<p>
<p>This is especially useful for body parts. If we would like to explore Voltaire's suggestion that history would have been very different if only Cleopatra's nose had been shorter, we will need noses:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A nose is a kind of thing. A nose is part of every person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Of course, if we make an assembly like this then we had better remember that the player is also a person and also gets a nose. In fact slightly odd things can happen if we combine this with changing the identity of the player. This works:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Cleopatra is a woman in Alexandria. The player is Cleopatra.
<br>A nose is a kind of thing. A nose is part of every person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but if those lines are in reverse order then Cleopatra's nose is assembled before she becomes the player, with the result that it ends up called &quot;Cleopatra's nose&quot; rather than &quot;your nose&quot; in play - which is very regal but probably not what we want. To avoid this, settle the player's identity early on in the source text.
<p>
<p>All of the assemblies above make objects. Most make these new objects &quot;part of&quot; existing ones, but as we saw, they can also be &quot;in&quot; or &quot;on&quot; them. In fact, though, assemblies work in much more general ways: they can assemble values of almost any kind, placed in almost any relationship. To make use of that, we need to create a new verb, a topic which won't be covered properly until a later chapter, but here goes:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, green and blue.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Liking relates various people to various colours. The verb to like (he likes, they like, it is liked) implies the liking relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every person likes a colour.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now every time a person is created, so is a colour which that person will like. If there are two people in the world, the player and Daphne, then we now have five colours: red, green, blue, Daphne's colour and the player's colour. Alternatively, we can assemble the other way around:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person likes every colour.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we're telling Inform that every time a colour is made, a new person is also made - someone who will like that colour. So this sentence effectively makes three new people, one who likes red, one who likes green, and one who likes blue.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e298"><a href=doc68.html#e298 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 54:  Being Prepared</b></a><br>A kind for jackets, which always includes a container called a pocket.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Being Prepared&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A jacket is a kind of thing. A jacket is always wearable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A pocket is a kind of container. A pocket is part of every jacket. The carrying capacity of a pocket is always 2.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After examining a jacket:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let target be a random pocket which is part of the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The target] contains [a list of things in the target].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we've created the rules that will govern any specific jackets we might happen to put in our game: each one will always have one pocket, which will be able to contain no more than two things. The description of &quot;a list of things&quot; is text with a list, which we will learn about further in a few sections.
<p>
<p>Next we might want to create the environment and an actual example of the jacket kind:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Tent is a room. &quot;A dome made of two flexible rods and a lot of bright green ripstop nylon. It bills itself as a one-man tent, but you'd call it a two-dwarf tent: there is no way to arrange yourself on its square floor so that you can stretch out completely.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The hoodie is a jacket. &quot;Your hoodie is balled up in the corner.&quot; The description of the hoodie is &quot;Both elbows are stained from yesterday's entrenching project.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The hoodie's pocket contains a Swiss army knife and a folded map. The hoodie is in the Tent.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Notice that, since Inform has created a pocket for the hoodie, we can now refer to it by name in our source, giving it any additional properties we need to define. Here we simply put a few items into it.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player wears a whistle. The description of the whistle is &quot;To frighten bears.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x hoodie / get hoodie / get knife / get map / i / put hoodie in pocket / put whistle in pocket / put map in pocket / put knife in pocket / i&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Notice that Inform automatically refuses to put the hoodie into its own pocket: as a default, a container cannot contain something of which it is itself a part.
