<p>
<p>The containers and supporters created so far have been boundlessly capacious: or rather, though we seldom notice the difference, have had a maximum carrying capacity of 100 items. This is clearly unrealistic for a small purse or a modest mantelpiece. We can impose upper limits with sentences like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The carrying capacity of the jewelled purse is 2.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The bijou mantelpiece has carrying capacity 3.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Attempts by the player to overfill, or overload, will now be rebuffed with a message such as &quot;There is no room on the mantelpiece&quot;.
<p>
<p>The player is not a container or a supporter, but nevertheless does have a carrying capacity: this is interpreted to mean the maximum number of items which can be carried at once.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The carrying capacity of the player is 4.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These restrictions only apply to the player (and other in-world characters): as the omnipotent creators, we are not restrained by them. Nothing prevents this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The carrying capacity of the jewelled purse is 2. The diamond, the ruby and the sapphire are in the purse.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The player will be able to remove all three items, but only put two of them back. (This is probably something we only want very occasionally: perhaps to create a sack stuffed almost to bursting point.)
