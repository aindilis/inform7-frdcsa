<p>Just as Inform normally assumes everything is solid, it also assumes that these solid objects will not buckle, crack, break or deform under pressure, and cannot be fragmented. But breakability adds realism, and breakage need not be negative: sometimes we want the player to break her way in to something.
<p>
<p>In IF the word DROP is more often used to mean &quot;put down&quot; or &quot;leave behind&quot; than &quot;let go from a height&quot;: so it is perhaps unfair that in <b>Ming Vase</b> something fragile, when dropped, shatters (into nothing). In <b>Spring Cleaning</b>, fragile objects must be explicitly attacked by the player in order to break, and although they leave no tangible debris behind, their loss is at least remembered. <b>Kyoto</b> provides a general-purpose model for things being thrown at other things, with consequences including things moving (even between rooms) as well as breaking each other.
<p>
<p>Debris from breakages is to be avoided if possible because it means keeping track of increasing numbers of objects. But we can increase realism by allowing something to have a visibly &quot;broken&quot; state, which it changes to when it breaks, rather than simply vanishing. <b>Terracottissima</b> provides for broken and unbroken flowerpots in this way.
<p>
<p>Since &quot;part of&quot; allows us to have two objects joined together into what the player sees as one, it also gives us a natural seam which allows the whole to be broken back down into its component parts, and this is the neatest way of providing a breakage into pieces. <b>Paddington</b> demonstrates a cutting action which allows component parts to be cut away from their holders but will only make small surface gashes in any individual thing: so the player can cut something up, but only into the pieces we specifically choose to allow. Cutting also forces an opening into containers.

<p>
<p>Here we have a destruction action that allows the player to break any fragile items. Once destroyed, these things are removed from play, but we can still refer to them: they are now off-stage. This makes it easy for our sulking character to list the ones that have been destroyed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Spring Cleaning&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be tough or fragile. A thing is usually tough.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of attacking something fragile:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You smash [the noun] to smithereens!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the noun from play.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A knick-knack is a kind of thing which is fragile.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when a knick-knack is off-stage and Granny Blue can see the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'Ohh,' whimpers Granny to herself softly. 'How I will miss [the list of off-stage knick-knacks]!'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Parlor is a room. Granny Blue is a woman in the Parlor. A china lamb, a porcelain milkmaid, a frolicking Dutch cow, and a crystal unicorn are knick-knacks in the Parlor.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;break lamb / break milkmaid / break cow / break unicorn&quot;.
