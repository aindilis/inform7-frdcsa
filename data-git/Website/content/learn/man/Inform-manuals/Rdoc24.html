<p>Some IF tries to make the viewpoint character more congenial to the player by allowing some customization.
<p>
<p><b>Identity Theft</b> demonstrates asking the player to supply the viewpoint character's name.
<p>
<p><b>Pink or Blue</b> demonstrates a way to let the player choose a gender at the start of play: this will mostly be interesting if the rest of the game makes some use of the player's choice. Since that example is written expressly to demonstrate included Inform 6 code, however, we may find it more congenial to generalize from the more flexible <b>Baritone, Bass</b>.
<p>
<p>This is not the only way to go - as we'll see in the next section, there's also something to be said for making the viewpoint character a strongly distinct creature with well-defined preferences and attitudes.
