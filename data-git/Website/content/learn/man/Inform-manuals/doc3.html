<p><img border=0 src=images/osx.png>The main window is an opened book showing two facing pages, and as we shall see it behaves as if these pages are in dialogue with each other: for the most part we write on the left hand page and see responses appear on the right. But all is controllable. The margin between the two pages can be dragged back and forth like the slide on a trombone: each page can be made smaller that the other may grow larger. Moreover, each page can display one of a number of displays relevant to the current project, called &quot;panels&quot;, one of them being the Documentation panel which displays this manual. The vertical strip of choices at the right hand margin of each page allows you to choose between panels. (The same panel can be showing on both pages at the same time, if that's useful.)

<p><img border=0 src=images/linux.png>The interface is extremely crude compared to that available on Mac OS X or Windows. The panels that exist are accessible via menu options, and anywhere you see reference to a button, it simply doesn't exist. Go and Release are implemented, as is Compile, which rebuilds the story but does not start it.  There is a further settings panel available to you, the IDE settings, which allows you to control which editor you wish to use to edit your project, which browser allows you to view HTML files, which interpreters to use to play your stories, and whether or not these should be run in the background. Users with a graphical desktop are likely to want to choose the background option, while those running only with text terminals will not. To select an option, type the letter indicated on the screen and follow it with the Enter key.

<p>At the start the only panels available are a blank space in which to write the first lines of a new interactive fiction - the Source panel - and this one, the Documentation. Clicking on the other choices will do nothing.
<p>
<p>The exception is the Settings panel, which contains some preference settings for the individual project - not the whole application. This is always available, but it controls settings which can be left alone almost all of the time.
