Liveliness</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>A character who sits still in a chair and does nothing is much less convincingly alive than one who seems to be pursuing some sort of personal agenda. There are all sorts of ways to achieve this, but the least challenging is by introducing some random change to descriptions, and by giving a character some very simple routine behavior to carry out.
<p>
<p>For instance, we'll often want the characters in a room to be described doing different things every time we look at them. <b>Camp Bethel</b> shows how this may be done.
<p>
<p>Every turn rules lend some sprightliness to otherwise-silent characters, as well:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when the player can see Mrs MacGillicuddy:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Mrs. MacGillicuddy vacuums around [a random fixed in place thing which is in the location].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We might expand on this by providing a whole table of things for Mrs MacG. to cycle through, or a text variation effect that gives her different activities every turn, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when the player can see Mrs MacGillicuddy:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Mrs. MacGillicuddy [one of]vacuums around the furniture[or]tries to remove gum from the underside of the desks[or]causes a racket by testing the smoke alarm[or]makes a pointed comment or two about them as sit by idly while someone works her fingers to the bone[as decreasingly likely outcomes].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is no great innovation in characterization by itself, but it does at least remind the player that the character is alive and moving about, even when he isn't paying attention to her.
<p>
<p><b>Annoyotron Jr</b> demonstrates a character who actively tries to get our attention, and whose routine of behavior changes just slightly if we show signs of having reacted to him.
<p>
<p><b>Lean and Hungry</b> implements a classic thief, a character who doesn't interact with the player much except to pick up valuable objects he finds left around the map. Later we will see rather more advanced ways to make characters act on their own goals and plans, but this kind of simple behavior is easily rigged as part of an every turn rule.
<p>
<p>Finally, <b>Text Foosball</b> extends the every-turn-rule idea to create an opponent who joins us in a randomized game of table soccer.
<p>
<p>With animal characters, this kind of repetitive, semi-random behavior is often adequate: we don't expect animals to talk, or pursue steady goals, or to take an interest in what we do in their presence (unless it involves a food they like to eat).
<p>
<p>For people, we are likely to need an assortment of additional techniques.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Lean and Hungry&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Substance is a kind of value. The substances are silver, gold, and lead. Everything has a substance. A thing is usually lead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is valuable if it is not lead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Limestone Cave is a room. &quot;Not very big, and it doesn't go back far, but you'd hoped to find some shelter here. Outside it is raining exceptionally hard.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The sinister gentleman is a man in the Cave. &quot;Leaning against the wall is a sinister gentleman in a threadbare waistcoat.&quot; The description is &quot;He looks as though he might once have been quite well off.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After examining the gentleman:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] smiles back at you in an unnerving fashion.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we make the rule that governs the gentleman's behavior. Here we're going to invoke the rules that allow characters besides the player to do actions. More about this can be found in the Advanced Actions chapter:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the sinister gentleman can touch something valuable (called the treasure) which is not carried by a person:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try the gentleman taking the treasure.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report the gentleman taking something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The gentleman] slyly acquires [the noun] and tucks it into his pocket.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>That &quot;not carried by a person&quot; prevents the gentleman from stealing from the player (or, less plausibly, from himself). If we did want him to pick pockets, we could just have said &quot;which is not carried by the gentleman&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player is carrying a coin, a bust of Abraham Lincoln, a bottle of sherry, a small pistol, and a wad of Confederate cash. The coin is gold. The pistol is silver.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A locket is in the Cave. The locket is gold. &quot;A broken gold locket lies on the ground, a token of your late Mama.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;get locket / i / drop locket / z / drop cash / z / x gentleman / drop all / z / z / look&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
