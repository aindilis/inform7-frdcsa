<p>We may want to change the default refusal message when the player tries to pick up scenery: <b>Replanting</b> demonstrates this case simply.
<p>
<p><b>Removal</b> modifies responses to successful TAKE commands, with the effect that when the player picks up an item, he gets a response such as &quot;You take the book from the shelf.&quot;
<p>
<p><b>Croft</b> modifies the DROP command, so that objects dropped on specific surfaces get reported in a special way. <b>Celadon</b> allows the player to drop even objects he is carrying indirectly, for instance on a tray or in a sack.
<p>
<p><b>Morning After</b> introduces a simple rule that changes the behavior of the whole game: whenever the player takes an item he hasn't already looked at, he automatically examines it. This picks up the pace of exploration passages where the player is likely to be collecting a large number of objects.
<p>
<p>By default, when the player tries to put or insert an item that he isn't holding, Inform prints a refusal message; <b>Democratic Process</b> and <b>Sand</b> offer ways instead to have the player first pick up the relevant items. (The former applies to single items the player is trying to place; the latter expands coverage to work even if the player uses a command affecting multiple objects.)
<p>
<p>Taking also happens as a result of other commands. Such takes can be made unnecessary with a procedural rule to turn off the &quot;carrying requirements rule&quot; under particular circumstances, or presented differently using the implicitly taking activity.

<p>
<p>The above example does not quite work when we want the player to be allowed to take multiple objects at once before putting them somewhere: we also need to add a couple of &quot;understand&quot; rules borrowed from many chapters later. While the reasons may not be immediately clear, we include the demonstration here for the sake of thoroughness:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Sand&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before inserting something which is not carried by the player into something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is in the second noun, say &quot;Already done.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(first taking [the noun]) &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try taking the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is not holding the noun, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before putting something which is not carried by the player on something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is on the second noun, say &quot;Already done.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(first taking [the noun])[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try taking the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is not holding the noun, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;put [things] in [something]&quot; as inserting it into. Understand &quot;put [things] on [something]&quot; as putting it on.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Closet is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A lentil is a kind of thing. A black-eyed pea is a kind of thing. The closet contains 3 lentils. The Closet contains 14 black-eyed peas. The round tin is a container in the closet. The round tin contains 17 lentils. The square tin is a container in the Closet. The square tin contains 20 black-eyed peas.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Sorting is a scene. Sorting begins when play begins. Sorting ends when all the lentils are in the round tin and all the black-eyed peas are in the square tin. When Sorting ends, end the story finally.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: say &quot;Thanks to your cruel stepmother, you're not going anywhere until the lentils and peas are sorted.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;put peas in square tin / put lentils in round tin&quot;.
