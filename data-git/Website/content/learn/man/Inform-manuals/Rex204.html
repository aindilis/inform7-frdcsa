<p>
<p>Money could be anything which the two people in a bargain both agree is valuable. Here, the player and an ogre agree on a copper coin as money:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a copper coin. The ogre carries a rock cake. The cake is edible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of giving the coin to the ogre:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the ogre carries the coin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player carries the cake;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The ogre grunts and hands you a rock cake.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now Inform does provide an action, &quot;buying&quot;, and a command for it, BUY, but they ordinarily respond simply &quot;Nothing is on sale.&quot; This is no longer true, so we should make BUY CAKE work. The difficulty here is that a command like BUY CAKE does not specify what should be handed over in exchange. Here we just check that the player has the coin, but in principle we could check for any of a range of monetary tokens - coins, notes, cheque book, debit card, and so on.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of buying the cake:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player has the coin, try giving the coin to the ogre;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;You have no money.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In more advanced economies, where shopping replaces barter, the seller will stock a wide range of differently priced goods. For a tabulated catalogue of wares, see <b>Introduction to Juggling</b>: to allow the player to negotiate prices, see <b>Money for Nothing</b>. In both of those examples, the player's current financial worth is simulated only as a current total amount of money carried - say, $2.50. This is typical, because in most situations what matters is how much money is in the pocket, not how it is made up. Money behaves more like a liquid than a set of items: hence terms like &quot;liquidity&quot;, &quot;cash flow&quot; or <b>Frozen Assets</b> - the name of the simplest example demonstrating this. If we really need a comprehensive simulation down to pieces of currency - where it makes a difference carrying four quarters rather than a dollar bill, because the quarters can be fed into a vending machine - see <b>Nickel and Dimed</b>.
<p>
<p><b>Fabrication</b> takes the problem in a different direction, making calculations about the cost of a new garment based on the price of the pattern, the quantity of fabric required, and the value of the fabric type chosen -- showing off what we can do with unit multiplication in Inform.
<p>
<p><b>Widget Enterprises</b> explores the challenge of pricing widgets for maximum profit, given certain necessary costs and customers with varying willingness to pay.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e204"><a href=Rdoc71.html#e204 STYLE="text-decoration: none">***<b><b>Example</b> 272:  Introduction to Juggling</b></a><br>Assortment of equipment defined with price and description, in a table.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we have a whole catalog-full of equipment that the player might want to purchase and use. We'll start by defining our purchasing rules:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Introduction to Juggling&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We allow things to have prices, and the player's price to indicate how much money the player has:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 1 - Mail-ordering defined
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Price is a kind of value. $100.99 specifies a price.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player has a price. The price of the player is $60.00.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Because we're allowing the player to order things that he can't currently see, we need to borrow a special kind of grammar from the Understanding chapter. All our orderable items in this example are toys, so &quot;any toy&quot; means any object of the toy kind, whether or not it is in view at the moment:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;buy [any toy]&quot; as ordering. Understand the command &quot;order&quot; as something new. Understand the command &quot;order&quot; as &quot;buy&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Ordering is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check ordering:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the cost of the noun is greater than the price of the player, say &quot;You only have [price of the player], while [the noun] would cost [cost of the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out ordering:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the noun to the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decrease the price of the player by the cost of the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report ordering:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You order [a noun], which is delivered instantly.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We should also handle the situation where the player orders another of something he has already bought and which is right in front of him:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of buying something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You already have [a noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So much for the general rules for this scenario. Now we move on to particulars: the actual items the player is allowed to order. Each item will have a description, a price, and a difficulty representing how skilled the player must be in order to make use of that item.
<p>
<p>Since we are going to use price and difficulty in the table that defines our juggling equipment, we need to mention these kinds of value before the line that says how toys are defined.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 2 - The Scenario
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Difficulty is a kind of value. The difficulties are easy, moderate, hard. The player has a difficulty. The difficulty of the player is easy.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The plural of toy is toys. A toy is a kind of thing. Some toys are defined by the Table of Juggling Equipment.
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>
<p>Notice that we are allowed to define &quot;description&quot; and other already-known properties in the table as well.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Backstage is a room. &quot;A muffled black room with felt on the floors and walls. A glowing sign over the stage door says SHOW IN PROGRESS.&quot;

<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Juggling is an action applying to one thing.
