<p>Under ordinary circumstances, Inform does not keep track of the player's posture, nor of his exact location in a room. <b>Lies</b> implements a room in which the player can lie in different positions on the floor, getting different views as a result.
<p>
<p>Our other examples are all modifications of the way Inform handles player movement to make better default guesses at what he wants to do: <b>Anchorite</b> adds a GET DOWN and DOWN command that work when the player is on a supporter, to accompany GET UP, GET OFF, and GET OUT (already understood). <b>Hagia Sophia</b> makes the player rise before heading in a compass direction, but only if movement in that direction is actually possible. And <b>Get Axe</b> makes the player get out of a portable container before attempting to lift it - a consideration that comes up relatively rarely, but that might pertain to inflatable rafts, beanbag chairs, and other lightweight but capacious pieces of furniture.

<a name="e222"><a href=Rdoc38.html#e222 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 299:  Lies</b></a><br>Commands to allow the player to lie down in three different ways.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>To set the scene, and make new actions to provide for two of these ways:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Lies&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Laundry is a room. &quot;An old Limehouse haunt, the Chinese laundry used by the down-trodden wives of the Tong of the Black Scorpion.&quot; The vast marble sink is here. &quot;There is nothing obviously oriental about the vast marble sink, which is large enough to lie down inside. A wooden-rack floor, equipped for easy drainage, turns out also to be equipped for snagging the shoes of passers-by.&quot; The sink is an enterable container, fixed in place.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Lying down is an action applying to nothing. Report lying down: say &quot;You lie down for a while in the middle of the Laundry, wondering about the point of existence, then get up again.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Lying near is an action applying to one thing. Report lying near: say &quot;You lie down next to [the noun] for a while, mumbling to yourself.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of lying near the sink, say &quot;Lying down close to the cool butcher's marble slabs of the sink, your attention is caught by the sight of coolie shoes through a floor-level grille for ventilation. The game is afoot!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So far, so good. Now for the grammar, where we create two new tokens: one for each of two groups of alternative prepositions.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;beneath/under/by/near/beside/alongside/against&quot; or &quot;next to&quot; or &quot;in front of&quot; as &quot;[beside]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;on/in/inside&quot; or &quot;on top of&quot; as &quot;[within]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;lie down&quot; as lying down.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;lie down [within] [something]&quot; as entering.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;lie [beside] [something]&quot; or &quot;lie down [beside] [something]&quot; as lying near.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;lie down / lie down on top of the sink / get out / lie down inside the sink / get out / lie down in front of the sink&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
