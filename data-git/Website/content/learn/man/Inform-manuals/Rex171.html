Liquids</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Liquids are notoriously difficult to simulate well. A fully thorough approach consumes endless storage and can be very finicky to write and keep realistic. It is essential to decide what aspect of a liquid's behaviour is actually needed in a given story, and to simulate only that. For instance, if we only need a little chemistry, where a player can add (say) water to salt and make a solution, we do not want to fool around with calculating quantities or concentrations: what's important is that &quot;some water&quot; (amount unspecified) combines with &quot;some salt&quot; to produce &quot;some salty water&quot;. We should no more calculate precisely here than we would work out where all the furniture is to the nearest inch. Good advice for handling liquids is to simulate the least amount of realism possible, but no less.
<p>
<p>Sometimes all we want is a down-in-one drink: we needn't simulate the actual liquid, just the bottle it comes in, and all we need is to handle the &quot;drinking&quot; action. See <b>Beverage Service</b>, and also <b>3 AM</b>, where carbonated drinks can be shaken - again simulating the vessel, not the liquid.
<p>
<p>Some elementary biochemistry in <b>Xylan</b> is done simply by... well, the point is that two different liquids are represented by single things each, and a chemical reaction simply switches one for the other.
<p>
<p>In <b>Frizz</b>, we allow any container to be filled (only) with water (only) and we simulate what happens to any solid objects also inside: some waterproof, some not. <b>Flotation</b> provides a well (always full of water), with rules to determine whether things dropped into it should sink or float.
<p>
<p>Next we move up to quantitative approaches, where we remember not just whether a liquid is present, but how much of it. In its simplest form, we could have a drinking vessel from which we draw in sips, so that it can be full, half-empty or empty: see <b>Thirst</b>.
<p>
<p>The example with the best compromise between simulation quality and complexity is <b>Lemonade</b>. Here we provide a kind of container called a &quot;fluid container&quot;, not just a single cup, and each such vessel has a given &quot;fluid capacity&quot;. Each holds only a single liquid at a time (so no mixtures) and can be empty or full to any level (rounded off to the nearest 0.1 fl oz). We can fill one vessel from another (unless it would make a mixture). But liquids leaving these vessels must be consumed - drunk or poured away without trace: we cannot make pools on the floor, or carry liquids in our cupped hands. There is no object representing &quot;lemonade&quot;: there are only fluid containers, but which can be called LEMONADE if that is what they now contain.
<p>
<p><b>Savannah</b> is a light elaboration of Lemonade, showing how liquids might be poured on other objects, as for instance to extinguish a fire.
<p>
<p><b>Noisy Cricket</b> extends <b>Lemonade</b> to allow for mixing, though then the number of different possible mixtures is so large that complexity increases greatly. <b>Lakeside Living</b> extends <b>Lemonade</b> differently to add a &quot;liquid source&quot; kind, a form of fluid container which has infinite fluid capacity and is scenery - ideal for a lake, river or spring.

<p>
<p>Suppose we have some items that get wet in contact with other damp things; in particular, if we touch anything wet while wearing a pair of gloves, the gloves too get damp. This requires that we be systematic about detecting all cases where contact occurs. So:

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A book is a kind of thing. Instead of examining a sodden book, say &quot;[The noun] is too soaked to read, thanks to someone's carelessness.&quot; Understand &quot;book&quot; as a book.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The copy of The Last Man is a book. The description of The Last Man is &quot;Mary Shelley's very own original copy, loaned to you under the strictest of agreements[if the pond encloses the copy]. How it came to be in its present position is a long story, and not important at the moment: the critical thing is not to blame oneself - who could have anticipated the cricket bat, anyway? - but to fix it immediately, before anything worse occurs[end if].&quot; The The Last Man is in the ziploc bag. The ziploc bag is waterproof and empty. It is openable, transparent, and closed.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Back Garden is a room. The Back Garden contains a pond. The pond is a waterfilled container. In the pond is the ziploc bag. A carp is in the pond. The carp is an animal. Instead of taking the carp, say &quot;You're not fast enough.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about the pond:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the pond encloses the Last Man:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;It is a beautiful day just at the end of spring and beginning of summer. The sun shines, the trees blossom, the world conspires in Edenic cheerfulness. You can take in none of it. Your eye is on [the Last Man].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The pond[if something is in the pond] (containing [the list of things in the pond])[end if] remains a figure of menace in an otherwise lushly verdant landscape.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before printing the name of the Last Man when the Last Man is enclosed by the Pond: if the Last Man is dry, say &quot;delicate, valuable &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the name of something (called the target) while writing a paragraph about something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the Last Man is enclosed by the Pond:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the target is in something (called the parent), say &quot; - which is in [the parent]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Kitchen is west of the Back Garden. &quot;Not in any sense your province: Mrs Peaswell gets agitated if anyone besides herself so much as boils a kettle. In general it is best to sneak through, disturbing as little as possible and preserving the cosy domestic fiction that academics cannot cook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The nearby stairwell leads up to the second floor.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Stairwell is above the Kitchen. &quot;Halfway up and halfway down.&quot; The airing cupboard is a container in the Stairwell. &quot;An airing cupboard here contains the heating system, and is the ideal place for restoring wet items to a dry state.&quot; The airing cupboard is fixed in place.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now: whenever the player definitely touches something, we want to follow certain rules about the transfer of liquid. These rules need to come after an action's check rules (to make sure the action really occurs) and before the carry out rules (so that nothing has moved or changed yet). So we'll borrow from the chapter on rulebooks to create a whole new stage to the action, occurring between the check and the carry out phases:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The post-check rules are a rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the post-check stage rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abide by the post-check rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The post-check stage rule is listed before the carry out stage rule in the specific action-processing rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A post-check rule (this is the dry glove rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if we get wet:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player wears the gloves and the gloves are dry:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the gloves are sodden;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(soaking your gloves in the process)&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A post-check rule (this is the wet glove rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player wears the sodden gloves:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the The Last Man must be touched and the Last Man is not sodden:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(soaking the parched pages of The Last Man with the rude touch of your sodden gloves)&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the The Last Man is sodden;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action.

<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if The Last Man is dry, say &quot;[The The Last Man] is too precious to endanger when you are not wearing gloves.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;You hesitate instinctively, then recollect that you can hardly harm [The The Last Man] any more than it has already been harmed...&quot;.
