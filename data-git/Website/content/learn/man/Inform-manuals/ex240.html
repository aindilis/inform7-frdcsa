<p>In practice it is not enough to apply &quot;if&quot; to a single phrase alone: we want to give a whole list of phrases to be followed repeatedly, or to be followed only if a condition holds.
<p>
<p>We do this by grouping them together, and there are two ways to do this. One is as follows:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To comment upon (whatever - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is transparent, say &quot;I see right through this!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is an open door:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Oh look, an open door!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is openable, say &quot;But you could always shut it.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here we group two phrases together under the same &quot;if&quot;. Note that the &quot;then&quot; has been replaced by a colon, and that the indentation in the list of phrases shows how they are grouped together. In the example above, the source moves two tabs in from the margin; the maximum allowed is 25.
<p>
<p>Indentation is the convention used in this manual and in the examples, but not everybody likes this Pythonesque syntax. So Inform also recognises a more explicit form, in which the beginning and ending are marked with the words &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To comment upon (whatever - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is transparent, say &quot;I see right through this!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is an open door
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Oh look, an open door!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is openable, say &quot;But you could always shut it.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Pythonesque because it's a style popularised by the programming language Python, named in turn after &quot;Monty Python's Flying Circus&quot;.)

<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Ransacking is an action applying to one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check ransacking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is not the location, say &quot;You can hardly search [the noun] from here.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out ransacking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the player can see a closed openable unlocked container (called target):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[target]: [run paragraph on]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try opening the target.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report ransacking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can see nothing further worth searching.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Russian Gift Shop is a room. In the Russian Gift Shop is a large wooden doll. It is closed and openable. In the large wooden doll is a medium wooden doll. It is closed and openable. In the medium wooden doll is a small wooden doll. It is closed and openable. In the small wooden doll is a tiny solid wooden doll.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now we need to borrow from a later chapter for the command that will make this work:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;search [any visited room]&quot; as ransacking.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;search gift shop&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
