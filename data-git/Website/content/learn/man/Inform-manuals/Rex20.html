<p>
<p>Money could be anything which the two people in a bargain both agree is valuable. Here, the player and an ogre agree on a copper coin as money:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a copper coin. The ogre carries a rock cake. The cake is edible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of giving the coin to the ogre:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the ogre carries the coin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player carries the cake;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The ogre grunts and hands you a rock cake.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now Inform does provide an action, &quot;buying&quot;, and a command for it, BUY, but they ordinarily respond simply &quot;Nothing is on sale.&quot; This is no longer true, so we should make BUY CAKE work. The difficulty here is that a command like BUY CAKE does not specify what should be handed over in exchange. Here we just check that the player has the coin, but in principle we could check for any of a range of monetary tokens - coins, notes, cheque book, debit card, and so on.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of buying the cake:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player has the coin, try giving the coin to the ogre;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;You have no money.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In more advanced economies, where shopping replaces barter, the seller will stock a wide range of differently priced goods. For a tabulated catalogue of wares, see <b>Introduction to Juggling</b>: to allow the player to negotiate prices, see <b>Money for Nothing</b>. In both of those examples, the player's current financial worth is simulated only as a current total amount of money carried - say, $2.50. This is typical, because in most situations what matters is how much money is in the pocket, not how it is made up. Money behaves more like a liquid than a set of items: hence terms like &quot;liquidity&quot;, &quot;cash flow&quot; or <b>Frozen Assets</b> - the name of the simplest example demonstrating this. If we really need a comprehensive simulation down to pieces of currency - where it makes a difference carrying four quarters rather than a dollar bill, because the quarters can be fed into a vending machine - see <b>Nickel and Dimed</b>.
<p>
<p><b>Fabrication</b> takes the problem in a different direction, making calculations about the cost of a new garment based on the price of the pattern, the quantity of fabric required, and the value of the fabric type chosen -- showing off what we can do with unit multiplication in Inform.
<p>
<p><b>Widget Enterprises</b> explores the challenge of pricing widgets for maximum profit, given certain necessary costs and customers with varying willingness to pay.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 1 - Prices and Bargaining
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Price is a kind of value. $10.99 specifies a price with parts dollars and cents (optional, preamble optional).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person has a price called wealth. The wealth of the player is $15.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing has a price called minimum value. The minimum value of a thing is usually $0.50.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing has a price called desired value. The desired value of a thing is usually $5.00.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Offering it for is an action applying to one price and one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;offer [price] for [something]&quot; as offering it for.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After taking inventory, say &quot;You have [the wealth of the player].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check offering it for:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the price understood is greater than the wealth of the player, say &quot;You don't have that kind of cash.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is not carried by someone, say &quot;There's no one in a position to sell you [the second noun].&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is carried by the player, say &quot;[The second noun] is already yours.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the minimum value of the second noun is greater than the price understood, say &quot;[The holder of the second noun] cackles disdainfully. 'If yer just here to insult me you can take your business elsewhere!' he says.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the desired value of the second noun is greater than the price understood:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let difference be the desired value of the second noun minus the price understood;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let difference be difference divided by two;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decrease the desired value of the second noun by difference;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the last object offered is the second noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'How about [desired value of the second noun]?' suggests [the holder of the second noun].&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless the desired value of the second noun is the price understood:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;From the avaricious gleam in the eye of [the holder of the second noun], you guess you could've gotten this purchase for less...&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out offering it for:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase the wealth of the holder of the second noun by the price understood;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decrease the wealth of the player by the price understood;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the second noun to the player.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report offering it for:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You spend [the price understood], and now you possess [the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: now right hand status line is &quot;Your funds: [wealth of the player]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now, since the man does make counter-offers, it would be reasonable to let the player accept or reject those, as well:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The last object offered is a thing that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of saying yes when the last object offered is carried by a person (called seller) who is not the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the seller is not visible:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the price understood is the desired value of the last object offered;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try offering the desired value of the last object offered for the last object offered.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of saying no when the last object offered is carried by a person (called seller) who is not the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the seller is not visible:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the last object offered is the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You reject the offer firmly.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And we borrow just a line or two from a later chapter to take care of some alternate syntax the player might try:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;offer [price] to [someone]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;You'll need to specify what you want to buy -- try OFFER $1000.00 FOR BROOKLYN BRIDGE.&quot;). Understand &quot;offer [someone] [price]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;You'll need to specify what you want to buy -- try OFFER $1000.00 FOR BROOKLYN BRIDGE.&quot;).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;buy [something]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;You'll have to name your price: try OFFER $1000.00 FOR BROOKLYN BRIDGE.&quot;).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 2 - The Scenario
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Flea Market is a room. The crotchety man is a man in the Market. &quot;A crotchety man here is selling [the list of things carried by the crotchety man].&quot; The crotchety man carries a broken television set, a Victorian rhinestone brooch, and a cracked shaving mug.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The minimum value of the brooch is $2.50.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;offer $0.50 for mug / offer $0.50 to man / offer $6.00 for mug / offer $50.00 for brooch / offer $1.50 for brooch / offer $4.50 for brooch / no / offer $4.50 for brooch / yes&quot;.
