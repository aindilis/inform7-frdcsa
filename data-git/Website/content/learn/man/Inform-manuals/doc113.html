<p>Three elaborations of action descriptions increase the range of possibilities further.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking something in the Supernatural Void, say &quot;In this peculiar mist you feel unable to grasp anything.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Like the objects to which the action applies, this location - the &quot;in&quot; clause - can take any description, not just an explicit place like &quot;Supernatural Void&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of listening in a dead end, say &quot;You strain to hear further clues as to the course of the underground river, but to no avail.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But we often want a rule to apply in any of a set of rooms: and where, unlike the &quot;dead end&quot; example above, the rooms have nothing much in common except where they happen to lie on a map. For instance, we might want a rule to apply only inside a given building, or a garden consisting of five miscellaneous rooms. If so, we can create a &quot;region&quot; as a convenient way to refer to that group of rooms:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Arboretum is east of the Botanical Gardens. Northwest of the Gardens is the Tropical Greenhouse.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Public Area is a region. The Arboretum and Gardens are in the Public Area.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of eating in the Public Area, say &quot;The curators of the Gardens are ever among you, eagle-eyed and generally cussed.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
