<p><img border=0 hspace=5 vspace=5 align=left src=images/mar07.jpg> As this release was prepared, the fence dividing Cyprus was dismantled at last - just as, for lack of such a fence, Switzerland accidentally invaded Liechtenstein; Mr Stark of California became the first Congressman in US history to declare his non-belief in God; the UK legislated for a 60% cut in carbon emissions by 2050; enigmatic lakes were imaged on Titan, and heavy snow fell in Kashmir; Martha Jones became Doctor Who's first black companion (if we don't count Frobisher the penguin); and the Bornean Clouded Leopard was declared a new species.
<p>
<p>In the immortal words of Robert Heinlein: &quot;Bugs, Mr. Rico! Zillions of 'em! I'm a-burnin' 'em down!&quot; Build 4S08 saw the first release of I7 for Linux, and there were useful reforms of the default value for kinds of value and of the paragraph breaking algorithm, but this was primarily a maintenance release. This release closed all 335 open bug reports, and marked the end of the experimental early days since the original Public Beta release.

This build represents a substantial update in five respects: it fixes all
known bugs - some 335 bug reports have been acted on since 4K41 and the
database of open bug report forms is now empty for the first time since
the public beta was released as 3K27; it introduces the first batch of
improvements proposed in the January 2007 consultation document (called
simply &quot;the January document&quot; below); it makes the first real reform of
paragraph-spacing since 3K27; it makes the first tentative steps towards
Inform 7 for Linux, though at present as a command-line system without the
graphical user interface; and it is accompanied by more supporting
materials than previous builds, notably free-standing documentation and a
formal grammar.

Inevitably it has a lengthy change log, which is grouped thematically below.
Enough minor changes have been made to the interpretations of syntax that
authors of any large work in progress will find at least one or two things
they need to change. Possible trouble-spots are marked with an arrow &gt;--&gt;.


INFORM 7 FOR LINUX

Inform 7 is now available for Linux for the i386, ppc, armv5tel, and s390
	architectures. All compilers and interpreters supplied as part of the
	Inform 7 package are statically linked and should have no dependencies
	beyond stdio. The i7 shell itself is written in Perl, but does not
	require any modules not customarily shipped as part of the Perl
	distribution. The only additional dependency is the uuidgen program;
	this is part of the ext2tools package and has so far been present as
	part of the default installation on all systems we have examined.
	Installation instructions can be found in the file INSTALL, and
	operational instructions in README or the manual page installed by
	the Inform installer.
Users on Intel 386-and-descendants machines should download the package
	I7_4S01_Linux_i386.tar.gz. All users on other architectures
	should download I7_4S01_Linux_all.tar.gz. The difference between
	these two is simply whether or not non-i386 compilers and interpreters
	are bundled - the &quot;all&quot; version will function perfectly well for Intel
	users, but it is substantially larger to download. The correct set for
	your architecture will be detected at installation time.


INFORM 7 FOR MAC OS X

The OS X application contains a number of bug fixes in the CocoaGlk layer,
	that is, to the underlying interpreters used in the Game panel.


INFORM 7 FOR WINDOWS

Pasting text into the source panel should no longer lose any trailing
	carriage returns.
Echo streams are supported in the game panel's Glk implementation.
Skein and transcript improvements:
	Knots that have been played in a game session are coloured
		yellow, and all other knots are coloured green.
	Knots with blessed text are lighter than those without.
	If the last played text for a knot does not match the blessed text,
		the node is shown with a red badge. Double clicking the red badge
		goes to the appropriate point in the transcript tab.
	The skein's context menu has been reworked to match the OS X
		application.
	A confirmation dialog appears when deleting a locked knot.
	Threads are automatically locked when blessed or when a label is added
		or changed.
Bug fixed whereby blue &quot;link to documentation&quot; icons were, in the most recent
	Windows build, in some cases off by one or two sections.


SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION

As from this build, we are uploading the &quot;Writing with Inform&quot; documentation
	in two plainer formats than those already available: plain text, and
	a zipped archive of minimally-tagged HTML files. We hope that this will
	make reference easier for those using screen-reading software, in
	particular. (This was (6.7) in the January document.)
We are also uploading a PDF document extracted from the NI source code which
	specifies the formal grammar read by NI (or rather, that part of it not
	already specified in the Phrasebook index): in the January document we
	expressed scepticism that this would really be useful, but responders
	disagreed. We continue to be sceptical, but it wasn't too hard to generate
	the document, so here it is.


EXAMPLES AND EXTENSIONS INCLUDED WITH INFORM

Examples:
	Added &quot;Apples&quot; to demonstrate &quot;asking which do you mean&quot; rules.
	Added &quot;Ahem&quot; to demonstrate phrases with alternate elements
		(the 300th example to be written).
	Added &quot;Pages&quot; to demonstrate phrases pertaining to specific values
	Added &quot;Hover&quot; to demonstrate interior descriptions of vehicles placed
		before the rest of a room description.
	Added &quot;Walls and Noses&quot; to demonstrate advanced modification of the
		disambiguation question.
	Added &quot;Electrified&quot; to demonstrate modification of the action-processing
		rule sequence.
	Added &quot;Straw Boater&quot; to demonstrate testing for the default text &quot;&quot;.
	Added &quot;Ferragamo Again&quot; to demonstrate phrases applying to specific objects.
	Added &quot;Mattress King&quot; to demonstrate modifying the action to push things
		between rooms.
	Added &quot;Lollipop Guild&quot; to demonstrate turning off implicit takes when
		eating an object that is fixed in place.
	Modified &quot;Abolition&quot; to reflect changes in the handling of &quot;to&quot; in
		action names.
	Corrected &quot;Neighborhood Watch&quot; to add a check for cases where the door
		is already locked or unlocked.	
	Assorted minor changes to examples to handle spacing changes.
Extensions:
	Locksmith: advanced to version 3 and made modifications due to the new
		spacing mechanisms.
	Glulx Image Centering: Corrected documentation.
	Rideable Vehicles: advanced to version 2. Rules added for people other
		than the player to mount and dismount vehicles; rule names given to
		the existing rules, so that they may be more easily revised or
		replaced by the user of the extension.
&gt;--&gt; Plurality: advanced to version 5, and forms of phrases changed to is-are
		(etc) rather than is/are. This will require authors using Plurality
		to do a search and replace to change formats. (Sorry.)
&gt;--&gt; Complex Listing: advanced to version 4, and forms of phrases change to
		is-are (etc) rather than is/are. This will require authors using
		Complex Listing to do a search and replace to change formats. (Sorry.)
		Behavior of &quot;[prepared list]&quot; changed to use no articles, just as
		&quot;[list...&quot; uses no articles now in Inform by default. More flexible
		phrasings added to several phrases, so that &quot;prepare list...&quot; is
		accepted as well as &quot;prepare a list...&quot;, and &quot;register the things...&quot;
		is accepted alongside &quot;register things...&quot;.
	Menus: advanced to version 2. Added options allowing up and down arrows
		to function properly under Glulx.


KINDS OF VALUE

When Inform has to initialise variables or property values, but the source
	gives no value, it uses a default value for the appropriate kind of value.
	For instance, a number is 0 unless otherwise specified, and a text is
	the empty text &quot;&quot;. The Kinds index (in which a number of minor bugs have
	been fixed) now tabulates the default values used for each kind of value
	which can be stored in variables or properties. (This and related changes
	following cover (6.34) in the January document.)
It is now legal to declare a &quot;specification text&quot; for a kind of value,
	analogously with kinds of object, and this is used in the Kinds index.
New scene &quot;Entire Game&quot; created which, as the name implies, contains the
	whole of play except for the posthumous restart, restore or quit
	conversation. (This is the default value for scenes.)
The constant &quot;nothing&quot; now means the absence of an object, in the context
	of testing an object-valued variable or property to see if it holds the
	default value for &quot;object&quot;, and is also useful when looking at the
	result of things like &quot;best route from the Drawbridge to the Keep&quot;
	(if there is in fact no route).
Problem message added to explain more fully when an action name is used as a
	new value (for instance, if we write &quot;Lamp strength is a kind of value.
	The lamp strengths are burning and gone out.&quot;, then &quot;burning&quot; would clash
	with the name of the action).
Bug fixed (in consequence of above) whereby creating but not initialising a
	scene variable or property caused an internal error.
Bug fixed whereby comparison of a text with &quot;&quot; often gave false negatives.


NAMED VALUES

&gt;--&gt; When ambiguous values occur, local variable names (created by 'called'
	or by 'let') are now given priority over other possibilities.
When a &quot;(called...)&quot; name appears in a rule, any article used will not be
	taken as an immutable part of the name. For instance, &quot;Instead of examining
	a door (called the portal): ...&quot; will now create a temporary value called
	just &quot;portal&quot;, not &quot;the portal&quot;. Of course, &quot;the portal&quot; can still be
	used to describe this value, but now being parsed as &quot;the&quot; + &quot;portal&quot;,
	and this means that text substitutions &quot;[a portal]&quot; and &quot;[the portal]&quot;
	can differ.
Problem message added to forbid the use of &quot;(called ...)&quot; when giving a
	complex range of things to be repeated through: this was accidentally
	allowed in previous builds, and produced subtly incorrect results.
Problem message added (in place of internal error) to catch attempts to use
	local values created by 'let' or 'repeat' or 'called' in past-tense
	references which pertain to times when they did not exist.
Problem message added to report contradictions of kind when a variable is
	declared more than once and each time as a kind of object.
Bug fixed whereby conditions involving negated existential quantifiers, and
	giving called names to the results, would sometimes incorrectly fail.
	(For instance, &quot;a person who is not wearing anything&quot; would work but
	&quot;a person (called the extrovert) who is not wearing anything&quot; would fail.
	The negated existential here is the clothing being worn - which is
	required not to exist.)
Bug fixed whereby &quot;a random D&quot;, where D is a description including a
	&quot;(called ...)&quot; clause, would (although legal) cause I6 errors.
Bug fixed whereby variables set up with non-existent kinds (&quot;Z is a
	bogosity that varies&quot;) would sometimes produce internal errors rather
	than a problem message.


TEXT

&gt;--&gt; Inform has a fairly delicate mechanism for placing paragraph breaks
	automatically at &quot;the right&quot; points in text produced by various different
	rules. Its aim is to save the writer from having to think about this.
	Four main defects have been found in the original Public Beta algorithm,
	and in this build we address all of them. We believe the result is a
	better system, but it does mean that the dodges people have used up to
	now to compensate for faults of the old algorithm will need to be
	removed or changed. (We had to remove a dozen or so spurious
	&quot;[line break]&quot;s from the Examples, for instance: the end result was
	much less intervention in how paragraphs were being broken, and this
	suggests that the automatic system is now more trustworthy.) This
	addresses proposal (6.45) in the January document.
When defining a new text substitution, it is now legal to add &quot;-- running on&quot;
	as a note at the end of the preamble. The effect of this is that any
	newline implied by the immediately preceding text is ignored. Thus
		To say note -- running on: say &quot;(1)&quot;.
	can be used in text such as
		&quot;I prefer to avoid footnotes.[note]&quot;
	without a newline being forced after the full stop under the &quot;sentence
	ending punctuation at the end of literal passages of text implies a
	newline&quot; convention.
This has been applied to the following character-level text substitutions in
	the Standard Rules:
		[unicode N]
		[bracket]  [close bracket]  [apostrophe]  [']  [quotation mark]
		[line break]
		[conditional paragraph break]  [paragraph break]  [run paragraph on]
		[bold type]  [italic type]  [roman type]
		[fixed letter spacing]  [variable letter spacing]
As a result, [line break] now does just and only what it suggests: prints a
	line break, regardless of circumstances, and with no side-effects for
	subsequent paragraph breaking. [paragraph break] is now the better way
	to force a paragraph break, and various bugs have been fixed so that it
	can more reliably be used in mid-string, in table entries, in values,
	more than once in the same quoted text, etc.
A new form of paragraph break has been created for one special circumstance:
	printing clarificatory text after a command, when we are guessing what
	was meant. For instance:
		&gt; N
		(first opening the Wicket Gate)
	Conventional spacing here is that text should immediately follow on the
	next line, unless we are going to a different room and looking around,
	in which case a line break should be added. We can get this spacing
	convention using the text substitution &quot;[command clarification break]&quot;;
	for instance:
		say &quot;(first opening [the noun])[command clarification break]&quot;;
Another change made to the paragraph breaking mechanism removes the previous
	discrepancy between the effect of printing an object property which does
	contain a text substitution, and one that doesn't; and similarly for texts
	used as values in miscellaneous other circumstances.
Finally, the text substitution &quot;[no line break]&quot; suppresses a line break
	which might otherwise arise under the sentence-ending punctuation rule
	as it applies to literal text in a &quot;say&quot;, so:
		say &quot;This is not the end![no line break]&quot;;
	leaves the printing position after the exclamation mark.
&gt;--&gt; The meaning of the text substitution &quot;[list of ...]&quot; has been changed so
	that it now lists the items referred to without articles: for instance,
	it might produce &quot;apple, orange and nectarine&quot; rather than &quot;an apple,
	an orange and a nectarine&quot;. (Which is what would have been produced in
	previous builds: to obtain the articled list, use &quot;[a list of ...]&quot;
	or &quot;[the list of ...]&quot; according to whether indefinite or definite
	articles are wanted. This was (6.21) in the January document.)
The text substitution ['] is now synonymous with [apostrophe], and makes
	extended runs of Cockney dialogue easier to type (&quot;put down that bleedin[']
	[']eavy Joanna&quot;, and so forth).
Problem message added for using 'say' (or a text substitution) to print a
	value of a kind which cannot be printed up (such as a parsing topic).
	(This already produced a problem message, but a generic unhelpful one.)
Problem message added for using a comma inside a text substitution, which
	in previous builds concatenated the items in the substitution - but that
	was almost invariably not what people expected, and it was being reported
	as a bug. (Thus previously &quot;[1, 3]&quot; was a legal substitution and printed
	up &quot;13&quot;, for example.)
Bug fixed whereby text substitutions which ended with one digit and were
	immediately followed by another digit in literal text would be corrupted.
	(For instance, in &quot;[if x is 2]2&quot;.)
Bug fixed whereby the little-used but legal &quot;say X, Y, Z&quot; comma-separated list
	form of &quot;say&quot; would lose some text substitutions occurring in terms in the
	list before the final one.
Bug fixed whereby replacing or cutting snippets in the player's command could
	cause spurious line breaks to be printed if the new text contained text
	substitutions.
Bug fixed whereby long texts containing almost the maximum legal number of
	text substitutions could crash NI.
Bug fixed whereby improperly closed double-quoted text, e.g., &quot;'fish&quot;' (note
	the mismatch of quotation marks) could produce I6 errors rather than a
	problem message.
Bug fixed whereby specifying literals involving double-quotes could cause
	I6 errors (e.g., writing: 5'10&quot; specifies a height). Still not a good
	idea since it throws syntax-colouring, but it's not meant to be illegal.
Bug fixed whereby the activity &quot;printing the name of something&quot; now applies
	to the player - previously, it applied to everything except the player.


PROPERTIES

&gt;--&gt; The ability to create a property without specifying its kind (by writing,
	say, &quot;A room has a property called history.&quot;) has been withdrawn. This
	was an undocumented syntax which gave the property the kind
	&quot;miscellaneous-value&quot;, whose use has for some time been deprecated.
	(In almost all cases, the property will be storing either objects or text,
	and should be given a kind accordingly. The Standard Rules no longer
	use properties or variables of this kind, and this change improves the
	reporting of problems in assertions using the properties in question.)
&gt;--&gt; We can now test to see if an object provides a property using the syntax
		if O provides the property P
	so for instance &quot;if the noun provides the property lockable&quot; - which a
	container or door would pass, but which a person would not, and so on.
	This was previously allowed as &quot;if O has a/an P&quot;, but that was too
	ambiguous and has been withdrawn. (It made grammatical sense only for
	value properties P. &quot;if the noun has a lockable&quot; not only read badly,
	but due to a bug (now fixed) it also compiled to an incorrect test.)
An indefinite article is now permitted in a negated assertion which sets the
	converse of an either/or property: thus &quot;X is not a P&quot; is permitted,
	just as &quot;X is not P&quot; would be. Grammatically this is incorrect if P is
	an adjective, which is what the original design of Inform intended, but
	people occasionally use nouns in an adjectival sort of way - for instance,
	&quot;A monkey can be a hairy critter. The ape is a monkey in the Serengeti.
	The ape is not a hairy critter.&quot; (Here P is &quot;hairy critter&quot;.) We continue
	to think this is poor style, but since the assertion would be allowed
	if in the positive sense, it seemed better to legalise it in the negative
	sense as well.
Problem message added for writing 'X can have P' rather than 'X has P' to
	create a property, since this is a common mistake and currently produces
	rather unhelpful problem messages.
Problem message rather than I6 errors for using a non-constant value (say,
	a variable) as the initial value of a property.
Problem message rather than I6 errors for creating a property with a name
	consisting solely of an article (e.g.: &quot;A thing has a number called the.&quot;),
	and similarly for property names containing commas or quoted text.
Problem message added to clarify what kind of contradiction has occurred
	when the same property is set to different values in different sentences.
Problem message added to report that new either/or properties or possible
	conditions (created by 'X can be Y or Z'-style sentences) clash with
	existing meanings - something which previously led to peculiar errors.
Run-time problem messages now result from attempting to change (with &quot;now&quot;)
	either/or properties for objects which are not permitted to have them.
Run-time problem messages now result from attempting to read or write value
	properties for the &quot;nothing&quot; non-object. (Previously writes were ignored
	and reads produced 0, but this was unsafe for kinds of value where 0 was
	not valid, and in any case allowing people to treat &quot;nothing&quot; as an
	object seems unwise.)
Bug fixed whereby &quot;now X is Y&quot; would compile I6 code which failed at run-time
	if X is a K that varies (K being some new kind of value) and Y is one
	possible value of K, in circumstances where K is also a property of objects.
	For instance, suppose we have colours blue and red, and colour is a
	property of cars. Suppose &quot;jalopy&quot; is a car that varies, &quot;hue&quot; a colour
	that varies. Then &quot;now the jalopy is blue&quot; and &quot;now the hue is blue&quot; are
	semantically very different - one changes a property, the other assigns
	a value - and this difference was being missed, hence the bug.
Bug fixed whereby tests of whether something has an either/or property would
	compile to code failing at run-time (whereas value properties would work).
Bug fixed whereby I6 errors might result from heavily ambiguous source texts
	where confusion could occur between wording of one phrase which does not
	include a property and another which does, where that property usage is
	itself incorrect.
Bug fixed whereby giving a property of something with an additional clause
	requiring it to be somewhere (e.g. &quot;the Portable Lamp in the Yard&quot;)
	would cause an internal error rather than produce a problem message.
Bug fixed (see KINDS OF VALUE) whereby creating but not initialising a
	scene property caused an internal error.


DEFINED ADJECTIVES

In &quot;Definition:&quot; sentences, it's now possible to refer to the object to which
	the definition applies as &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot; or &quot;they&quot;, or indeed &quot;him&quot;, &quot;her&quot;
	or &quot;them&quot;, and no longer only as &quot;it&quot;. Thus &quot;Definition: a person is other
	if he is not the player.&quot; is legal, as is, and let's not squabble over the
	rightness of this, &quot;Definition: a person is other if they are not the
	player.&quot; The accusative forms mean that &quot;Definition: a person is a target
	if the player can see him.&quot;, etc., should also work now.
A problem message has been added to forbid ambiguous settings of
	properties for adjective-qualified kinds, as in &quot;The description of an
	open door is ...&quot;: such a sentence looks as if it might create a rule
	which would dynamically check the door during play, but in fact being
	an assertion it only looks at the initial state. (In previous builds,
	a bug caused this to set the description for every door, initially open
	or not: rather than fix this, it seemed better to forbid this form of
	assertion entirely, since if it worked it would still not do what it
	looked as if it did.)
Similarly, a problem message has been added to forbid assertions at compile
	time about adjective-qualified kinds where the adjective cannot be
	determined until run-time (because it is created with &quot;Definition:&quot; and
	involves some computation to decide whether an object satisfies it or not).
Problem message rather than I6 errors for using &quot;change O to P&quot; where O is
	an object and P is a defined adjective (rather than a property), so that
	it is not logically possible to change P by merely saying so.
Run-time problem messages now result from attempting to change (with &quot;now&quot;)
	adjectival properties which cannot be forced to come true, since their
	truth is governed by a fixed definition.
Bug fixed whereby definitions of adjectives based on testing a property to
	see if it equals some specific value (e.g. &quot;Definition: A container is
	standard if its carrying capacity is 7.&quot;) would in fact test a range
	of values with this as boundary (e.g. capacity &lt;= 7).
Bug fixed whereby definitions of adjectives with a specific object as domain
	(e.g. &quot;Definition: the Ballroom is dusty if...&quot;) would not always be given
	priority over definitions with a more general kind as domain (e.g.
	&quot;Definition: a room is dusty if...&quot;).


HEADINGS

Problem message added to report that a heading stops before the end of its
	line, something which generally happens when a full stop has been misread.
Bug fixed whereby an author name including a comma would be mis-spaced in the
	banner (for instance if the first line is: &quot;Trio&quot; by Rod, Jane and Freddy).
Bug fixed whereby a heading which followed a long comment without an intervening
	skipped line would sometimes wrongly be rejected as containing a line break.


ASSERTION SYNTAX

When ambiguous assertion sentences occur, where more than one word is in
	principle valid as the primary verb, we now assume that &quot;to have&quot; is the
	most likely verb, followed by &quot;to be&quot;, and then the other built-in verbs.
	This replaces the previous doctrine that the earliest valid verb in the
	sentence was the true one. For instance, &quot;The last support is a thing
	that varies.&quot; is now read with &quot;is&quot; as the primary verb, not &quot;support&quot;.
Problem message added to catch what look like mistaken uses of the pronoun
	&quot;they&quot;. (E.g., in &quot;A and B are things. They are portable.&quot;, I7 can't
	cope with &quot;they&quot; as meaning the collection of A and B, and would previously
	latch onto some other meaning, e.g., either A or B alone.)
Problem message added for using 'every' on the wrong side of the verb in an
	assertion sentence (mostly to take the opportunity to explain how to
	reword such a sentence so that it works).
Problem message added (in place of internal error) to catch misreadings of
	'of' leading to misunderstood property values in assertions, e.g. in
	&quot;The dining room is a room in the house east of the kitchen.&quot;
Problem message added (in place of internal error) to catch relative clauses
	which seem to express a location in a way too complicated to follow, e.g.
	&quot;Sleeping Beauty is a woman who is asleep in the Spinning Tower.&quot;
Bug fixed whereby listing complicated descriptions of things which involved
	at least one negated property would cause I6 errors.
Bug fixed whereby negated relative phrases would mistakenly be read as
	positive, so that for instance &quot;The broken box is a container which is
	not openable.&quot; would, very unfortunately, make an openable container.
Bug fixed whereby implications in the form of &quot;An X is usually Y&quot;, where X
	involves a kind and also properties, would in fact cause all things of
	that kind to be Y, whether they matched or not. (For instance, &quot;an open
	container is usually lockable&quot; would cause all containers not otherwise
	described to be lockable.)
Bug fixed whereby &quot;some&quot; as an article would be confused with &quot;some&quot; as a
	determiner in such a way that the actual object being referred to was
	lost: this especially happened with singular mass nouns, e.g. &quot;some clay&quot;,
	where &quot;if the player is carrying some clay&quot; would be misread as &quot;if the
	player is carrying something&quot; if the clay was a single thing, not a kind.
Bug fixed whereby the assertion &quot;X is here.&quot; might fail if X had already
	been defined before the room denoted by &quot;here&quot; had been declared; and
	also another case in which the room, having been mentioned long ago,
	is only recently made the subject of discussion again.
Bug fixed whereby descriptions with multiple relative clauses, some of them
	ambiguous, could result in an interpretation which is none of the
	possibilities an English speaker would choose. (This is difficult to
	define, but for instance, &quot;a random woman who is not Zoe in the location
	of Zoe&quot; was being interpreted in such a way that &quot;in the location of Zoe&quot;
	was being applied neither to the random woman, nor to Zoe. Inform now
	applies it to Zoe. This affects only a handful of sentences - e.g., it
	makes no difference to any sentence in any of the examples - and only
	to sentences which are fairly evidently risky in the first place.)
Bug fixed whereby object names containing &quot;with&quot; could, in the middle of
	lists, crash NI.


PLURALS

The previous requirement that a plural definition sentence had to appear before
	it could be used has been lifted. Such definitions now apply throughout
	the source text, wherever they appear. This avoids traps like the following:
	&quot;Clothing is a kind of thing. The plural of clothing is clothes. Clothes
	are wearable.&quot; In previous builds, this would have created an object called
	&quot;Clothes&quot;, which is wearable but is not of the kind &quot;clothing&quot;, and a
	kind called &quot;clothing&quot; with the plural &quot;clothings&quot;.
Bug fixed whereby non-specific references to properties in &quot;every turn&quot; rules
	would be taken to be properties of the I6 library placeholder object,
	usually leading to strange I6 veneer errors: they are now assumed to be
	properties of the player. Thus for instance
		A person can be poised or flustered. Before jumping: now the player
		is flustered. Before waiting: now the player is poised.
		Every turn when flustered: say &quot;You feel flustered.&quot;
	...now works as expected.
Bug fixed whereby ordinal numbers were being taken as counting determiners
	for noun phrases, so for instance &quot;2nd Room&quot; was being read as if it
	had the same meaning as &quot;two rooms&quot;. This led to confusion when room
	names (in particular) began with an ordinal, e.g., &quot;2nd Floor Balcony&quot;.
Bug fixed whereby words which indicate plurals will not always be recognised
	as such if the object whose name is being parsed has a complex range of
	possible names (i.e., if I7 is obliged to compile a parse_name routine to
	handle it).


RELATIONS, PARTS AND REGIONS

&gt;--&gt; Some people have had problems with the relation &quot;in&quot;, when applying it
	to regions. Inside Inform, there are two forms of &quot;in&quot;: there is object
	containment - the ball is in the box, the box is in the Summer House -
	and also region containment - the ball is in the Garden Area, the
	Summer House is in the Garden Area. These two forms of &quot;in&quot; are not
	as similar as they look - object containment has the property that a given
	X can be &quot;in&quot; Y for at most one possible Y, and Inform makes heavy use
	of this in optimising searches and loops; but region containment does
	not, becase the Summer House could be in the Garden Area and also in
	the super-region the Outside World, say. In practice, Inform always
	reads &quot;X in Y&quot; as object containment except when Y is the literal name
	of a region. Up to now, there has been no way to describe the hidden
	internal relation for region containment: in this build, we provide
	&quot;regionally in&quot; to allow users to clarify what sense they mean. Thus
	&quot;repeat with P running through the rooms regionally in R begin; ...&quot;
	makes clear that we are talking about all rooms in R (and not, for
	instance, rooms immediately in R rather than in some subregion of R).
&quot;A part of&quot; is now synonymous with &quot;part of&quot;: for instance, one can now write
	&quot;if the tail is a part of the fish&quot;, with the same effect as &quot;if the tail
	is part of the fish&quot;.
Problem message added to prevent foundational errors involving an object being
	indirectly a part of itself (&quot;X is a part of Y. Y is a part of X.&quot;, and
	so on).
Problem message added to report that a region has been placed inside more than
	one other region. (This is forbidden because it could lead to configurations
	whereby regions overlap, whereas they are required always to include each
	other or else be disjoint.)
Problem message added for an attempt to declare an already-existing object as
	a region. (This is never necessary, and when it occurs it is almost always
	a symptom of an inadvertent clash of names.)
Run-time problem message added for attempts to find routes or count steps
	through relations not permitting this. (Previously such attempts would
	be allowed but, not very helpfully, invariably come back as finding no
	possible route. This was misleading.)
Bug fixed whereby finding best routes through the map from A to B would fail
	with a programming error at run-time if A or B were nothing: Inform now
	works in these cases, returning the information that no route exists.
	(Similarly for counting steps, and for finding routes through relations.)
Bug fixed whereby the built-in relations were not being given names as values,
	so that for instance Inform would fail to understand &quot;containment
	relation&quot; even though there is a relation called &quot;containment&quot;.
Bug fixed whereby relations defined by a condition would, if defined between
	different kinds of thing, sometimes lose track of what kinds they were
	defined over: so that run-time type-checking errors could be produced
	because the definition was applied to objects of the wrong kind.
Bug fixed whereby some tests amounting to seeing whether a given room is in
	a given region, in the course of a condition, would fail.
Bug fixed whereby a backdrop asserted as being in more than one region would
	only appear in the first region asserted (though also in any rooms it was
	asserted as being in: the bug applied only to multiple regions).


TABLES

&quot;Increment&quot; and &quot;decrement&quot; are now synonyms for &quot;increase&quot; and &quot;decrease&quot;.
	Moreover, they can now also be used on table entries (e.g. &quot;increase
	pollen count entry by 2&quot;).
&quot;Choose the row with...&quot; is now synonymous with &quot;choose row with...&quot;.
Problem message added for placing blank entries in the first column of a table
	which is creating named objects or values, something which makes no sense
	since the first column provides the names.
Problem message added to report duplicated table names (which are not
	continuations of each other).
Problem message for using a table reference at a time when no row has been
	selected has been clarified to explain why text substitution can make
	this time not the time which several users thought.
Problem message for using a table reference in a condition set in the past
	tense and thus relating to a time when no row had been chosen.
Problem message for using a table reference in a complex condition which
	requires loops over objects in ways very likely resulting from a
	misunderstanding (and which in any case can't be compiled safely if
	taken at their literal meanings).
Problem message added for &quot;Some X are defined by the Table of T&quot; where X is
	something unrecognised, and another for where X describes a specific
	object rather than a kind. (It needs to be a kind of object or value.)
Bug fixed whereby repeating through a table &quot;in reverse order&quot; (not in reverse
	order of any specific column, just in reverse order of its natural order)
	would produce I6 errors.
Bug fixed whereby sorting a table would (almost) always move blank rows to
	the top: it now invariably moves blank rows to the bottom, regardless of
	the direction or column of sorting, as the documentation implies it should.
Bug fixed whereby any continuation of a table was being treated as if written
	under the same heading in the source text as the start of the table:
	which meant that any problem messages, and also any object name
	disambiguation, would be handled at the wrong position.
Bug fixed whereby &quot;change TE to V&quot;, where TE is a table entry and V is some
	value to be put there, was not being type-checked - so that one could,
	for instance, change a textual entry to a number, with subsequently
	unfortunate results. (This is particularly insidious in the case of
	changing a topic entry to a textual string, which can't safely be done
	at run-time, and will crash the interpreter during later parsing.)
Bug fixed whereby the condition &quot;if S is a topic listed in T&quot;, where S is a
	snippet (e.g. &quot;the player's command&quot;) and T has a topic column, would
	produce programming errors at run-time rather than perform the necessary
	matching.
Bug fixed whereby the condition &quot;if there is an X of Y in T&quot;, to see if the
	X column of table T ever contains Y, failed to compile if T was
	expressed in a way not using the word &quot;table&quot; (for instance, if T was
	a table-name which varies).
Bug fixed whereby naming a table in such a way that the first word of the
	name was an article (e.g. &quot;Table of A Students&quot;) would make that table
	subsequently difficult to refer to.
Bug fixed whereby some properties given by columns in tables which define
	a batch of objects would, if they seemed always to contain other objects,
	sometimes cause an internal error and so fail to compile.
Bug fixed whereby references to entries in tables in the past could produce
	internal errors.
Bug fixed whereby defining a quoted text as an enumerated value of a kind of
	value using a table (a foolish but just about legal thing to do) caused
	I6 errors.


TO... PHRASES

&gt;--&gt; Phrase declarations can also now give literal values as the only possible
	match. For instance, defining:
		To hazard (N - a number): say &quot;[N]! That's Numberwang.&quot;
		To hazard (N - 14): say &quot;[N]... oh, sorry, Julie, that's NOT Numberwang.&quot;
	means that using a phrase like
		hazard X;
	will produce the exceptional message if X is 14, and the standard one
	otherwise. For instance, if we tried this with X repeating through a
	loop, we might see:
		13! That's Numberwang.
		14... oh, sorry, Julie, that's NOT Numberwang.
		15! That's Numberwang.
	If we had not defined the general case (&quot;To hazard (N - a number)&quot;), then
	attempting to use
		hazard X;
	for any value of X other than 14 would have produced a run-time problem.
	(This was (6.29) in the January document.)
Phrase declarations can now give alternatives for any single literal word
	using slashes (using the same convention that grammar tokens follow).
	For instance,
		To pour (N - a number) gallon/gallons: ...
	makes the phrase match with either &quot;gallon&quot; or &quot;gallons&quot; as the last
	word; except that &quot;say&quot; is never permitted as the first word of a
	phrase, just as now, because &quot;To say ...&quot; declares a text substitution
	instead. (This was (6.26) in the January document.)
&gt;--&gt; Because of this, all existing To... definitions containing words with
	a slash in them, such as &quot;and/or&quot;, will need to be changed. In particular
	the text substitution &quot;[is/are a list of...]&quot; and similar forms have been
	changed to &quot;[is-are a list of...]&quot;, and the same principle (exchanging
	slashes for hyphens) has also been followed for the extensions: see above.
Problem message added to prevent source text trying to redefine &quot;now ...&quot; by
	creating &quot;To now X is 2&quot; and similar constructions - these tend not to
	work, and are highly misleading when they do.


IF AND OTHERWISE

An additional problem message has been added to catch a subtle syntax mistake
	which previously led in some cases to I6 errors. This is to do with the
	possible interpretations of &quot;otherwise if&quot;, as shown by the following:
		Report going from Alpha to Omega:
			if Omega is visited begin;
				say &quot;You retrace your steps, but it's just not the same.&quot;;
				otherwise if turn count &lt; 2, say &quot;Unhesitatingly, you set out.&quot;;
			end if.
	This is actually illegal, because &quot;otherwise (phrase)&quot; can only occur
	immediately following an &quot;if (condition), (phrase)&quot;: the form of otherwise
	used to divide up cases within a blocked if (such as the &quot;Omega is visited&quot;
	one) is just &quot;otherwise if (condition)&quot;. The new problem message intercepts
	this mistake. The correct text would be:
		Report going from Alpha to Omega:
			if Omega is visited begin;
				say &quot;You retrace your steps, but it's just not the same.&quot;;
			otherwise if turn count &lt; 2;
				say &quot;Unhesitatingly, you set out.&quot;;
			end if.
	(While at first sight the incorrect syntax looks innocuous enough - why not
	simply allow both forms? - this becomes ambiguous if the statement does
	indeed follow a simple &quot;if&quot; within the larger &quot;if&quot; block.)
The problem message arising from &quot;if C&quot;, where C is not recognised as a
	condition, has been made more helpful in the case where C is a compound
	condition. (For instance: &quot;I was expecting that 'score is 1 or 2 or lemon
	sherbet explodes in the dark' would be a condition, but I couldn't make
	sense of it that way. 'score is 1' was okay; '2' only made sense as a
	value, which can't be used as a condition; 'lemon sherbet explodes in the
	dark' did not make sense; and nor did the condition make sense as all
	one text.&quot;)
Problem message rather than I6 errors for using &quot;otherwise ...&quot; as following
	immediately on an &quot;if ... begin&quot; block opening. (It would be legal to
	use &quot;otherwise&quot;, or to use &quot;otherwise ...&quot; after a non-blocked &quot;if&quot;.)
Bug fixed whereby &quot;if ...&quot; might fail to yield problem messages where a
	complicated condition included arithmetic performed on named values
	which do not exist.
Bug fixed whereby giving more than one &quot;otherwise;&quot; clause in an &quot;if&quot; block
	did not provoke any problem message. (It now does.)


CONDITION SYNTAX

When a phrase can be used as a condition (i.e. when it is a phrase &quot;to decide
	if...&quot;), &quot;not&quot; followed by that phrase can also be used as a condition.
	In particular, &quot;when not in darkness&quot;, &quot;if not using the memory economy
	option&quot;, etc., now work.
&quot;Can not&quot; is now synonymous with &quot;cannot&quot;: for instance, &quot;if the player can
	not see the fish&quot; is equivalent to &quot;if the player cannot see the fish&quot;,
	and similarly for &quot;if the player can not be seen by the fish&quot;.
Problem message added to catch accidental omissions of verbs in some
	descriptive conditions (say, writing &quot;if small key inside box&quot; instead
	of &quot;if small key is inside box&quot;: it would open the door to too many
	ambiguities to allow these customary omissions in general).
Bug fixed whereby tests of whether &quot;A is unable to B&quot; would be parsed as if
	they were &quot;A is able to B&quot;, i.e., with the negation lost: for instance,
	&quot;...when Peter is unable to see the bridge&quot; would be read as if &quot;...when
	Peter is able to see the bridge&quot;.
Bug fixed whereby testing whether something unlocks something else would
	compile through I7 but then cause I6 errors.


MISCELLANEOUS SYNTAX

An explanatory problem message, rather than an internal error, now results
	from using 'total ... of' in a way too complicated to handle.
Bug fixed whereby clashes of names as between ordinary phrases and arithmetic
	phrases could result in unhelpful problem messages on legal source text:
	for instance, creating a property called &quot;times played&quot; and then
	evaluating &quot;total times played of all tracks&quot; would be confused with
	trying to multiply &quot;total&quot; by &quot;played of all tracks&quot;, even though this
	interpretation made no sense.
A name-space clash causing the Standard Rules to conflict with any kind whose
	name included the word &quot;item&quot; has been removed.


RULES AND RULEBOOKS

Problem message rather than internal error for the case of a rule which
	happens when an activity is being applied to X, but X is not a
	description of something.
Problem message rather than I6 errors for attempting to write an inline
	I6 definition of a rule. (Only allowed when defining &quot;To...&quot; phrases.)
Problem message added for a rule whose name contains a comma. (No, really.
	People have tried to do this.)
Bug fixed whereby saying that a named rule is listed first, in a rulebook
	already containing other named rules, would sometimes have no effect.
Bug fixed whereby declaring that a new named rule should be listed instead
	of an existing (and built-in) action rule, e.g. the &quot;can't go that way
	rule&quot;, would sometimes cause the new rule not to have the same implied
	actor conventions as the old one - for instance, even though the &quot;can't
	go that way rule&quot; applies to all actors, its replacement might only
	apply to the player, so that NPCs were able to walk through walls.
Bug fixed whereby the result of a rule was not allowed to be another rule,
	so that &quot;rule succeeds with result X&quot; would fail in the case of X being
	a rule - while printing a problem message explicitly claiming that a rule
	was one of the legal alternatives here.
Bug fixed whereby rules attached to actions happening &quot;for the first time&quot;
	(or with similar stipulations) would sometimes, in the case of complex
	actions, fire more than once during the same turn. This bug has been
	seen particularly in response to &quot;After going from X to Y for the first
	time&quot;, where the rule fired both after the going, and then also after
	the subsequent looking action in the same turn.
Typo fixed in Rules index: it should be &quot;action-processing rules&quot;, not
	&quot;action processing rules&quot;. (Some people thought this rulebook could not
	legally be referred to as a value - actually it can, but this typo
	caused them to get the name wrong. Apologies.)


ACTIONS

&gt;--&gt; The relationship between the actions &quot;getting off&quot; and &quot;exiting&quot; has been
	reversed. Suppose the player is on a chair, a supporter. In previous
	builds, EXIT would cause the exiting action directly, but GET OFF CHAIR
	would cause the getting off action, which would quickly convert into an
	exiting action. This worked fine, but meant that a rule like:
		Instead of getting off the sticky chair, say &quot;You can't! It's too
			sticky.&quot;
	would only apply to one of the two commands, anomalously. In this build,
	it is exiting which converts to getting off (provided that the actor is
	indeed on a supporter). (This also fixes a bug to do with NPCs and the
	convert get off to exit where possible rule, which no longer exists.)
The problem message for mis-describing an action with the form &quot;A or B or ...&quot;
	now itemises the listed actions to say which are valid and which not,
	and also warns if one of these is a named kind of action (which is not
	allowed in a list like this). It also handles the case of &quot;doing something
	except A or B or ...&quot;.
Problem message added for past-tense references to the &quot;noun&quot; or &quot;second
	noun&quot; which certainly will not do what their authors intend, because
	the values of these quantities have changed over time.
Problem message added for complicated past-tense references to the &quot;going&quot;
	action. (The old problem message amounted to &quot;I don't understand this&quot;,
	the new one &quot;I do understand this, but I'm still not going to do it&quot;.)
Problem message added for describing a &quot;going&quot; action in terms of objects
	which are of the wrong kind to make sense - going from or to a non-room-
	or-region, through a non-door, with or by a non-thing. This only catches
	cases which the compiler can spot, involving specific named items, but
	this is more useful than it sounds (especially if a room name includes
	the word &quot;by&quot; in lower case, and Inform has wrongly taken this as a
	preposition).
Bug fixed whereby moving the player during the course of a rule attached
	to an action being carried out by somebody else would cause any resultant
	looking action to apply to that other person, rather than the player,
	so that instead of a description of the player's new room we might either
	see nothing or something like &quot;Miss Marple looks around.&quot;, depending
	on where the third party is at that point in the action.
Bug fixed whereby somebody arriving in the player's room as a result of a
	&quot;going&quot; action would always be described as arriving from the opposite
	direction as that of initial travel - so if he had gone east, he would
	now be said to have arrived from the west, for instance. This is fine
	for untwisted, two-way routes, but not otherwise. Inform now only does
	this where the reverse journey can be made in the reverse direction,
	possibly via a two-way door; and otherwise simply says that the person
	&quot;arrives&quot;.
Bug fixed whereby a spurious &quot;You must name an object.&quot; error would be printed
	in response to a command requesting somebody to carry out an action which
	applied only to a single topic.
Bug fixed whereby &quot;try looking&quot; would sometimes fail with a spurious &quot;You
	must name an object.&quot; error if it occurred during an action which applied
	to a value rather than a thing.
Bug fixed whereby an action caused by &quot;try&quot; would sometimes not have the
	appropriate &quot;... understood&quot; values correct if the action applied to a
	value rather than a thing.
Bug fixed whereby an action whose name takes the form &quot;... to something&quot;
	could be referred to without the &quot;to&quot;. As a special case and because
	of its status as an optionally-nouned action, this is still allowed
	for &quot;listening&quot; (properly speaking the action is called &quot;listening to&quot;),
	but forbidden for new actions.
Bug fixed whereby lists of actions would sometimes, in certain orders and
	where ambiguity between different length actions occurred, wrongly cause
	problem messages. For instance, &quot;Instead of taking off or dropping the
	jodhpurs&quot; would fail (note ambiguity between &quot;taking&quot; and &quot;taking off&quot;)
	whereas &quot;Instead of dropping or taking off the jodhpurs&quot; would work.
Bug fixed whereby ambiguities caused by abbreviation of action names
	(for instance if we have actions &quot;weighing&quot; and &quot;weighing it with&quot;,
	what do we say that the rule &quot;Before weighing&quot; applies to?) are now
	resolved in favour of the least abbreviated name (here, &quot;weighing&quot;).
Bug fixed whereby tests of intransitive past tense actions (e.g. &quot;we have
	woken up&quot;, no object, rather than &quot;we have taken the box&quot;) were
	performed incorrectly, usually producing false negatives.
Bug fixed whereby action reporting would suddenly cease after a NPC tried
	an action involving a door or backdrop. (The mystically-named &quot;untouchable
	silence&quot; bug, which Khelwood posted a (correct) fix to RAIF for.)
Bug fixed in the implementation of the ACTIONS testing command whereby
	the information that a tried action had just failed would sometimes be
	destroyed by the act of printing things information out.
Bug fixed whereby some complicated check, carry out or report rules would
	fail to appear in the Actions index.
Bug fixed whereby check rules applying to the final action performed would be
	posthumously applied also to the attempt at restoring the game produced
	by typing RESTORE in reply to the post-game question &quot;Would you like to
	RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?&quot;


SCENES

&gt;--&gt; A small but quite important change has been made to the scene changing
	mechanism which affects the order in which things happen when there are
	multiple scene endings. For instance:
		Home is a room. The cube and the ball are here.
		Shape Choice is a scene. Shape Choice begins when play begins.
		Shape Choice ends roundly when the player carries the ball.
		Shape Choice ends squarely when the player carries the cube.
		Consequence is a scene. Consequence begins when Shape Choice ends.
		When Consequence begins:
			if Shape Choice ended roundly, say &quot;Roundly.&quot;;
			if Shape Choice ended squarely, say &quot;Squarely.&quot;
	Suppose the cube is taken. This used to cause the following sequence of
	events:
		Shape Choice ended
		Consequence began
		Shape Choice ended roundly
	It was necessary for Shape Choice to end the regular way before the exotic
	way, so that consequent rules could happen, but the ordering was unfortunate,
	because it meant that the rule in the source above happened at a time when
	it wasn't known whether the scene had ended roundly or squarely - only that
	it had ended. Since it's very useful to know how the previous scene ended
	in order to begin the next one, this is unfortunate. The change means that
	the sequence is now:
		Shape Choice ended
		Shape Choice ended roundly
		Consequence began
	and so the rule above works after all, printing &quot;Roundly.&quot;
It is now possible (optional, that is) to use a &quot;the&quot; in giving a rule for
	a scene beginning or ending: thus &quot;When the Afternoon begins:&quot; is now
	synonymous with &quot;When Afternoon begins:&quot;.
Two new phrases for scenes have been added: &quot;the time since S ended&quot; and &quot;the
	time when S ended&quot;, exactly parallel to &quot;the time since S began&quot; and &quot;the
	time when S began&quot;. (Previously, the &quot;began&quot; time was being interpreted as
	the most recent time at which S either ended or began - this was a bug, and
	has been fixed.)
New scene &quot;Entire Game&quot; created: see KINDS OF VALUE.
Bug fixed whereby a scene which begins &quot;when play begins&quot; and also when a
	condition holds now begins in either case (previously, the condition was
	being ignored, and some users thought it was illegal to specify a condition
	in this case - actually it was a bug).
Bug fixed whereby begin/end conditions of scenes would not be properly
	disambiguated if relying on an ambiguously phrased phrase to decide
	the outcome, resulting in I6 errors for what was correct source text.
Bug fixed whereby begin/end conditions of certain forms, such as past tense
	actions, were rejected altogether with spurious problem messages.
Bug fixed whereby if scene A is set to end when scene B ends, but in fact
	B ends at a time when A has never started, ending rules for A would be
	erroneously run anyway.
Bug fixed whereby creating a scene that varies called X could sometimes also
	create a scene called X. (Except for cluttering the index, this would
	only be harmful if the name of X happened to end with &quot;scene&quot;, but of
	course people do tend to name such things &quot;current scene&quot;, etc., so...)
Bug fixed (see KINDS OF VALUE) whereby creating but not initialising a
	scene property or variable caused an internal error.


WHEN PLAY BEGINS

Bug fixed whereby attempting to enter a closed container which in fact
	already enclosed the actor (but indirectly so) would fail the &quot;can't enter
	closed containers rule&quot; rather than the &quot;can't enter what's already
	entered rule&quot;, resulting in a slightly misleading reply.
Bug fixed whereby calculations of visibility made during &quot;when play begins&quot;
	rules would be incorrect because the player object had not yet been put
	into its starting position.
Bug fixed whereby changing the player to a new player-character and then
	moving that PC during &quot;when play begins&quot; rule to a container or supporter
	would have the final movement disregarded.


OBJECT MOVEMENTS

&gt;--&gt; Scenery is now usually &quot;fixed in place&quot;. This makes little difference
	since it can't normally be taken, but in previous builds it usually had the
	&quot;portable&quot; property, and this meant that (for instance) &quot;repeat with the
	item running through the portable things in the location ...&quot; would
	unexpectedly include scenery.
Bug fixed whereby moving an object from room to room (say, by writing &quot;now
	the row-boat is in the Rapids&quot;) would cause the location to be wrongly
	set internally if the object contained the player (because an I6 PlayerTo
	call would never occur), which would make certain room descriptions print
	wrongly.
Bug fixed whereby &quot;remove D from play&quot;, where D is only a vague description
	of things, would compile I6 code which failed at run-time rather then
	produce a problem message.	


LIGHT

Bug fixed whereby another person in the same room, openly carrying a light
	source, was not counted as lighting that room.


UNDERSTANDING

In previous builds, the activity &quot;reading a command&quot; has happened only around
	the original command being typed. If the player types TAKE POLISH, the
	activity winds up: if, later, the parser asks a follow-up question such
	as &quot;Which do you mean, the Polish sausage or the shoe polish?&quot;, this
	question is not framed by the activity. That remains the case, but if
	the question results in a rewritten command, Inform now - exceptionally -
	follows the &quot;after reading a command&quot; rulebook for a second time.
Problem message rather than internal error for confusing an activity with an
	action in an &quot;Understand ... as ...&quot; sentence.
Bug fixed whereby, if we give define a noun as a legal command by writing e.g.
	&quot;Understand &quot;[something]&quot; as examining.&quot; and then the player types
	something unrecognisable, the parser replies &quot;You can't see any such
	thing.&quot; (presuming we were intending to type a noun) rather than &quot;That's
	not a verb I recognise.&quot; (presuming a verb - which seems more likely).
Bug fixed whereby the message &quot;** Warning: grammar properties might not work
	correctly **&quot; would occasionally appear when a game began playing (but
	not in a released version).


USE OPTIONS

The &quot;the&quot; in the condition &quot;using the ...option name... option&quot; has been
	made optional: for instance, &quot;if using no scoring option&quot; is now allowed.
Bug fixed whereby using memory economy did not suppress all the RULES ALL text,
	thus not economising as much as it might.


EXTENSIONS

Problem message added to explain that extension names should be unquoted
	in Include sentences.
Bug fixed whereby extensions ending without documentation would sometimes
	produce a spurious problem message on their end lines, unless these
	were followed by at least one one blank line.


PUBLISHING

Bug fixed whereby releasing along with a website stopped working in 4K40/1.
	Particular apologies for this.
Bugs fixed whereby Unicode translations were not properly preserved in
	released websites, notably in title, blurb and source text when written
	as HTML.


WORLD INDEX

Problem message added to clarify that mapping hints can only be given laterally
	(so e.g. &quot;Index map with Overlook mapped above Great Plain&quot; does not work).
Bug fixed causing &quot;yourself&quot; (the player) to appear twice in the World index
	in some situations.
Bug fixed whereby disconnected areas of map would sometimes appear on vastly
	distant vertical levels from each other, with peculiar resulting map
	legends. (See e.g. the map for &quot;Port Royal 2&quot; under 4K41 or earlier.)


PROBLEM MESSAGES

Bug fixed whereby some problem messages concerning phrases would be reported
	as being in the text under the final heading in the source text, rather
	than the headings under which they actually occurred.
Bug fixed whereby problems occurring in text substitutions inside quoted text
	which forms a whole sentence (e.g., as an implicit room description)
	were reported as being at peculiar sentences.
A number of problem messages which users reported as unclear have been reworded.
