<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> The parser is the part of the run-time software, included in all works produced by Inform, which tries to match the player's command against the grammar provided by the work. When it is unable to make a valid match, the parser prints an error to the player: for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">> BIFURCATE TREE
<br>That's not a verb I recognise.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There are some 19 possible messages. The one which the parser wants to say is stored in the variable &quot;latest parser error&quot;, which has the convenient kind &quot;command parser error&quot;. This has the following possible values:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">didn't understand error
<br>only understood as far as error
<br>didn't understand that number error
<br>can't see any such thing error
<br>said too little error
<br>aren't holding that error
<br>can't use multiple objects error
<br>can only use multiple objects error
<br>not sure what it refers to error
<br>excepted something not included error
<br>can only do that to something animate error
<br>not a verb I recognise error
<br>not something you need to refer to error
<br>can't see it at the moment error
<br>didn't understand the way that finished error
<br>not enough of those available error
<br>nothing to do error
<br>I beg your pardon error
<br>noun did not make sense in that context error
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> Prints the message in question.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) Perhaps for newcomers:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing a parser error:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;If you are new to interactive fiction, you may like to try typing HELP.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(b) Or to give the parser a certain amount of character:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the I beg your pardon error:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;What's that? Speak up, speak up.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing a parser error:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;That's a rum thing to say, and no mistake.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e435"><a href=doc314.html#e435 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 366:  WXPQ</b></a><br>Creating a more sensible parser error than "that noun did not make sense in this context".<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>The parser error &quot;That noun did not make sense in this context&quot; arises instead of &quot;You can't see any such thing&quot; when the player uses a command that could apply to any item in the game -- that is, a command such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;go to [any room]&quot; as going directly to.
<br>Understand &quot;talk about [any subject]&quot; as discussing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...and so on. The idea here is that &quot;You can't see any such thing&quot; isn't a sensible rejoinder when the player doesn't really need to be able to see the object.
<p>
<p>Nonetheless, &quot;That noun did not make sense...&quot; is itself a fairly dry and uninformative response, and we may want to override it to something more appropriate for the specific kind of context in which it might appear. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;WXPQ&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">WXPQ Studio is a room. &quot;After about 2 AM, no one is listening anyway, so you can more or less make up whatever you like to fill the airwaves.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">John F Kennedy, Elvis, Ralph Nader, Tony Blair, and single-origin chocolate are things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;talk about [any thing]&quot; or &quot;discuss [any thing]&quot; as discussing. Discussing is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out discussing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You babble for a while about your [one of]interest in[or]hatred of[or]passionate devotion to[or]conspiracy theory concerning[or]mother's secret love affair with[as decreasingly likely outcomes] [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the noun did not make sense in that context error:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;For once, you're at a loss for anything to say.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;discuss Elvis / discuss Kennedy / discuss chocolate / discuss narratology vs ludology debate&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that this solution works as simply as it does because we only have one command in the game that can apply to an &quot;[any]&quot; token. If we had several, we'd need to distinguish between the parser error attached to &quot;discuss&quot; and the parser error attached to &quot;go to&quot; (for instance). In that case, we might instead write something like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the noun did not make sense in that context error:
<br>if the player's command includes &quot;go&quot;:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;There's no such place you know how to get to.&quot;;
<br>otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;For once, you're at a loss for anything to say.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
