<p>
<p>Inform's &quot;door&quot; kind provides for a tangible thing which comes between one room and another. A door can be open or closed, and openable or not: it can be locked or unlocked, and lockable or not. Here we create a conventional door, a natural gap in the rocks, and a (fixed in place) wooden ladder:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The fire door is an open door. The fire door is east of the Projection Booth and west of the Fire Escape.
<br>The narrow crevice is an open unopenable door. The crevice is east of the Col du Prafleuri and west of Rocky Knoll Above Arolla.
<br>The wooden ladder is an open unopenable door. The ladder is above the Stableyard and below the Hay Loft.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Most doors are visible from both sides: they are single objects but present in two rooms at once, which raises a number of complications. Inform normally uses the same description looking from each way, which is not very interesting: <b>When?</b> and <b>Whence?</b> demonstrate neat ways to describe the two sides differently, and <b>Whither?</b> adds the option for the player to refer to doors as &quot;the west door&quot; and &quot;the east door&quot; automatically.
<p>
<p><b>Neighbourhood Watch</b> goes further by making a door behave differently on each side: from the &quot;outside&quot; you need a key, but &quot;inside&quot; it opens on a latch. Finally, <b>Garibaldi 1</b> shows how to access information about the two sides of a door.
<p>
<p><b>Higher Calling</b> demonstrates doors which automatically open as needed: though using the Inform extension Locksmith by Emily Short is probably easier and better. <b>Elsie</b>, conversely, demonstrates a door that closes one turn after the player has opened it.
<p>
<p>Certain complications apply when characters other than the player have to see and interact with doors that exist in other rooms. <b>Wainwright Acts</b> demonstrates the syntax needed to handle this technically quirky situation.
<p>
<p><b>Something Narsty</b> and <b>Hayseed</b> provide a &quot;staircase&quot; kind useful for vertically arranged, always-open doors like staircases and (fixed in place) ladders.
<p>
<p><b>One Short Plank</b> implements a precarious plank bridge across a chasm as an open unopenable door.

<a name="e161"><a href=Rdoc12.html#e161 STYLE="text-decoration: none">***<b><b>Example</b> 21: Garibaldi 1</b></a><br>Providing a security readout device by which the player can check on the status of all doors in the game.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we would like to allow the player to view the status of all the doors functioning in the game; and we want to identify those doors by mentioning which two rooms they connect. The following uses some techniques that will be covered in later chapters, but the basic idea may be obvious:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Garibaldi&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The security readout is a device. The description of the readout is &quot;The screen is blank.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the switched on security readout:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The screen reads: [fixed letter spacing]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say line break;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through doors:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say line break;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;  [item] ([front side of the item]/[back side of the item]): [if the item is locked]LOCKED[otherwise]UNLOCKED[end if]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say variable letter spacing;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say paragraph break.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>It is more or less arbitrary which room winds up as the &quot;front side&quot; and which as the &quot;back&quot;, but in this case it hardly matters.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries the security readout.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Docking Bay is a room. The inner airlock is a door. It is north of the Docking Bay and south of the Zocalo. The inner airlock is lockable and unlocked.  The outer airlock is lockable and locked. It is a door. It is south of the Docking Bay and north of Space.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The quarantine seal is a door. It is west of the Zocalo and east of Medlab. Quarantine seal is locked.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The security pass unlocks the inner airlock. The player carries the security pass.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x readout / turn on readout / x readout / lock inner airlock with security pass / x readout&quot;.
