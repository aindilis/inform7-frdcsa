<p>What does &quot;in&quot; mean? It's worth just a brief diversion to cover this, because &quot;in&quot; has two subtly different meanings.
<p>
<p><b>Meaning 1.</b> Usually, if X is &quot;in&quot; Y then this is because of containment. A croquet ball is &quot;in&quot; a croquet box, which is &quot;in&quot; the Summerhouse. This is the standard meaning, and is the one which happens if we write something like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The croquet ball is in the box.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>or if we ask a question like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the croquet box is in the Summerhouse, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This kind of &quot;in&quot; talks only about direct containment. If we ask
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the croquet ball is in the Summerhouse, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then the answer is that it isn't - it is in the box which is itself in the Summerhouse, but that's not the same thing.
<p>
<p>This is almost always the meaning of &quot;in&quot; that we intend. This is only one of a number of relationships between objects - there are also &quot;part of&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;worn by&quot; and &quot;carried by&quot;, for example. If we have
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The bird feed is on the sundial.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...then &quot;if the bird feed is in the sundial&quot; won't be true: the relationship here is one called support (being on top of, in effect), not containment. But there's no confusion because &quot;on&quot; and &quot;in&quot; are different words, so it's no problem that they have different meanings.
<p>
<p><b>Meaning 2.</b> Much less common. If X is &quot;in&quot; Y and Y is a region, then the meaning is slightly different. Suppose the Garden Area is a region, and contains several rooms - the Croquet Lawn, the Terrace and so on. Then
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the croquet box is in the Garden Area, ...
<br>if the bird feed is in the Garden Area, ...
<br>if the Terrace is in the Garden Area, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>are all true. This seems very natural, but in fact is quite different from the first meaning of &quot;in&quot;. It allows rooms (and even other regions) to be &quot;in&quot; a region, and it allows indirect containment.
<p>
<p><b>How Inform decides.</b> So which meaning does Inform use, and when? Since these two meanings are so different, it clearly matters.
<p>
<p>The answer is that meaning 1 is always the meaning of &quot;X is in Y&quot; unless Y is explicitly the name of a region. Thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the croquet box is in the Garden Area, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>is meaning 2, because &quot;Garden Area&quot; is the name of a region. That seems fair enough, but in later chapters, we'll see that values are sometimes given names (becoming &quot;variables&quot;, or values &quot;that vary&quot;). Suppose &quot;mystery value&quot; is a name for a value which is an object, but which has different identities at different times. Then Inform reads
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the croquet box is in the mystery value, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>as meaning 1, because whatever &quot;mystery value&quot; is, it isn't explicitly a region name, even if from time to time it might happen to be equal to a region.
<p>
<p>That sometimes makes meaning 2 difficult to express. If we ever need it, and this is fairly rare, we can write it like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the croquet box is regionally in the mystery value, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because &quot;regionally in&quot; is always meaning 2 of &quot;in&quot;.
