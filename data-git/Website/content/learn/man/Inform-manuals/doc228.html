<p>Going back to our weight example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A weight is a kind of value. 10kg specifies a weight.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The notation here is a single word, even if it contains digits as well as letters - &quot;10kg&quot;. But it doesn't have to be one word. These would have worked, too:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">10kg net specifies a weight.
<br>10 kg specifies a weight.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In fact, we are allowed to have all three at once, as alternatives:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A weight is a kind of value. 10kg specifies a weight. 10kg net specifies a weight. 10 kg specifies a weight.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we often have to deal with large weights, it becomes a little cumbersome to keep on writing something like &quot;80000kg&quot;. An engineer would write &quot;80 tonnes&quot; for this. Similarly, we wouldn't like road maps to use light years, or speed limit signs to use furlongs per fortnight. So it's sometimes useful to provide a spread of different notations, at different scale factors, for the same kind of value. Here's one way of setting up the tonne, that is, the metric ton:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">1 tonne specifies a weight scaled up by 1000.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This really is an alternative way to write the same thing: for instance, Inform will allow &quot;25kg plus 3 tonne&quot;, the result being &quot;3.025 tonne&quot;.
<p>
<p>That's all very well, but a value like &quot;3 tonne&quot; reads a little oddly, even if it's correct in theory. Outside of scientific journals with old-school copy editing, most people would write &quot;3 tonnes&quot;, not &quot;3 tonne&quot;. Here's a better try:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">1 tonne (singular) specifies a weight scaled up by 1000.
<br>2 tonnes (plural) specifies a weight scaled up by 1000.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now Inform will not only recognise both forms, but also use the right one when printing back.
