Goal-Seeking Characters</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Goal-seeking characters are the most advanced IF life-form: they want to achieve specific outcomes, and they are able to work out plans of approach in order to bring these things about. They walk to rooms, open containers to search for things, use keys and tools, and ask leading questions in conversation.
<p>
<p>A really advanced implementation of goal-seeking behavior is beyond the scope of our examples (though extensions exist that treat the problem more thoroughly). We can accomplish a surprising amount without heavy customization, though, if we keep in mind three points of technique:
<p>
<p>First: it helps to think abstractly and to create broadly-defined actions as a first step to more specific tasks. For instance, a character's goal might be to eat some dinner. He'd be equally satisfied with spaghetti carbonara or with braised lamb shanks, but he needs to figure out which is available. So we might have our every turn rule (or whatever we're using to activate the character) say something like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when Clark is hungry:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try Clark dining.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Dining would then be an action we've defined specially, which looks around Clark's environment for suitable food; if it finds food, it issues a
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">try Clark eating the suitable food;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>command; but if not, it sends Clark off to look for something likely. <b>The Man of Steel</b> demonstrates the use of this.
<p>
<p>Second: though it doesn't actually contribute to the goal-seeking per se, lively reporting brings characters' generated behavior to life.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Clark eats a donut.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>doesn't characterize Clark very much, even though the eating may be part of a subtle, intelligent plan to seduce Lois Lane. We'll do better if we replace a lot of the character reporting rules: to that end, see the example <b>Reporting rules for other characters' behavior</b>.
<p>
<p>Third: goal-seeking characters notice when something is in the way of the action they want to perform. When that happens, they form a plan about how to remove the obstacle. We've already seen this kind of implementation on the player's behalf: the player will pick up items before eating them, say. We can use Before rules to do similar things for other characters, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before Clark eating the wrapped candy:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try Clark unwrapping the candy;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the candy is wrapped, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here we've set things up so that if Clark tries to eat the wrapped candy, he'll be interrupted by this other command; and if his unwrapping-the-candy attempt fails, he won't go on and eat the thing. <b>IQ Test</b> demonstrates a character who shows this kind of planning intelligence.
<p>
<p>Because before-rules chain neatly, we can trigger whole plans of behavior if we have a sensible set, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before someone entering a closed container: try the person asked opening the noun.
<br>Before someone opening a locked container: try the person asked unlocking the noun.
<br>Before someone unlocking a locked container: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We must exercise a little bit of care if it is possible for the chain of actions to produce an endless loop - e.g., the character trying to take a key that is inside the transparent, locked box that it opens might repeatedly try to open the box, first unlocking the box, first taking the key, first opening the box, ... <b>Boston Cream</b> is a fully-worked scenario that deals with such a set of conundra.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Report rules can be a good point at which to add local color: while Inform provides default descriptions of character behavior, these are rather generic and can stand to be customized.
<p>
<p>For instance, if we wanted to liven up our previous Clark Kent example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report Clark Kent going a direction (called the way):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[one of]With a particularly weak excuse[or]Muttering[at random] about [random excuse subject], Clark heads [way].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say random excuse subject:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose a random row in the Table of Lame Excuses; say &quot;[reply entry]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Table of Lame Excuses
<br>reply
<br>&quot;needing a paper-clip&quot;
<br>&quot;wanting an English-Tuvalu dictionary&quot;
<br>&quot;walking a neighbor's dog&quot;
<br>&quot;hearing air-raid sirens&quot;
<br>&quot;having drunk too much coffee&quot;
<br>&quot;thinking he smells smoke&quot;
<br>&quot;wondering where Lois got to&quot;
<br>&quot;needing to speak to Jimmy&quot;
<br>&quot;noticing the Good Year blimp&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>It's good to be careful, as the library report rules have been designed and tested to describe every contingency (going through doors, going in vehicles, etc.): so when replacing a report rule, we should try to consider all the possible variations of the action that we might want to describe.
<p>
<p>However, in this case, our scenario is so simple that there are no doors, vehicles, or pushable objects, so we're safe in giving Clark a very simple reporting scheme.
