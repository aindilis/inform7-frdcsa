<p>
<p>We have now seen two ways to write the outcome of a rule: as simple success or failure, with more or less explicit phrases like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">rule succeeds;
<br>rule fails;
<br>continue the action;
<br>stop the action;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and by using a named outcome for the current rulebook as if it were a phrase, as in:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">low background noise;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There is still a third way: we can stop a rule and at the same time produce a value. This isn't needed very often - none of the built-in rulebooks in the Standard Rules produces a value.
<p>
<p>As we've seen, every rulebook has one kind of value as its basis, and it also has another kind of value for it to produce. If we call these K and L, then we have altogether four ways to write down the kind of a rulebook:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">rulebook
<br>K based rulebook
<br>rulebook producing L
<br>K based rulebook producing L
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we don't mention K, Inform assumes the rulebook is action based. If we don't mention L, Inform assumes L is &quot;nothing&quot;, that is, Inform assumes no value is ever produced. Thus
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Drum summons rules is a rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>is equivalent to
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Drum summons rules is an action based rulebook producing nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But let's now look at a rulebook which does produce something.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The cat behavior rules is a rulebook producing an object.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This rulebook works out which thing the cat will destroy next. We might have rules like this one:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Cat behavior when Austin can see the ball of wool:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds with result the ball of wool.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The value is produced only when a rule succeeds, using this phrase:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>rule succeeds with result </b>(value)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_succeedswith -->

<p>This phrase can only be used in a rule which produces a value, and the value given must be of the right kind. It causes the current rule to finish immediately, to succeed, and to produce the value given.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>How are we to use the cat behavior rulebook? If we write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">consider cat behavior
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then the rulebook runs just as any other rulebook would, but the value produced is lost at the end, which defeats the point. Instead, we might write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the destroyed object be the object produced by the cat behavior rules;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the destroyed object is not nothing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Austin pounces on [the destroyed object] in a flurry.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the destroyed object.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The key phrase here is
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">object produced by the cat behavior rules
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which accesses the value this rulebook produces. In general, we write:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b></b>(name of kind)<b> produced by </b>(rule producing values)<b></b> ... <i>value</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_producedby -->

<p>This phrase is used to follow the named rule, and to collect the resulting value.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
