Scoring</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Not every work of IF allots a numerical score to the player: for some authors, this emphasises the idea of a game rather than a narrative. The simple sentence
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use no scoring.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>abolishes the concept. Otherwise, Inform will provide built-in support for a single number measuring progress (&quot;score&quot;), and will expect to measure this against a maximum possible (&quot;maximum score&quot;, which can either be set by hand or worked out automatically from a table of ranks).
<p>
<p>In a game in which scoring exists, the player may choose to turn score notifications (such as &quot;[Your score has just gone up by one point.]&quot;) on or off. The commands to do this are NOTIFY ON and NOTIFY OFF; the actions are called switching score notification on and switching score notification off. In the event that we need to amend the behavior of notification, we could do so by adding, removing, or modifying the elements of the check and carry out rulebooks for these commands; as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check switching score notification off:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the turn count is less than 10:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You are still a novice, grasshopper. Allow your teacher to give you advice until such time as you are ready to go on alone.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we wish to change the wording of the default message (&quot;[Your score has...&quot;), we may want to resort to extensions available from the Inform website which allow access to all the default messages in a game.
<p>
<p>An especially insidious style of bug allows the player to type the same sequence of commands over and over, earning score endlessly for the same insight, and to avoid this it is usually safest to write source like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After taking the Picasso miniature when the Picasso miniature is not handled:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;award 10 points; say &quot;As they say in Montmartre: dude!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We might also write our condition with &quot;for the first time&quot;, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After jumping for the first time:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;award 5 points;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Boing! That was certainly entertaining.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But we should be careful not to use &quot;for the first time&quot; in scoring situations where it's possible for the player to try the action but fail. Inform counts even unsuccessful attempts towards the number of times an action is understood to have occurred, so if the player tries to jump and fails, his &quot;for the first time&quot; will be used up and he will never receive the score points.
<p>
<p>If there are many &quot;treasure&quot; items like the Picasso miniature, it is best to be systematic, as in <b>No Place Like Home</b>. <b>Bosch</b> takes another approach to the same idea, by creating a table of point-earning actions that the player will be rewarded for doing; the FULL SCORE command will then play these back.
<p>
<p><b>Mutt's Adventure</b> demonstrates how we might add a scored room feature, such that the player earns a point when he first arrives at a special room.
<p>
<p>A single number does not really sum up a life, or even an afternoon, and <b>Goat-Cheese and Sage Chicken</b> and <b>Panache</b> offer more detailed citations. Works that are more story than game may prefer to offer a plot summary of the player's experience to date in lieu of more conventional scoring.
<p>
<p>Finally, <b>Rubies</b> provides a scoreboard that keeps track of the ten highest-scoring players from one playthrough to the next.

<p>And... at that point you're a lot less close to being done than you think. The filling -- onions, sage, apricot, and cheese -- must be assembled and put in the chicken breasts; these tied up in string; each roll dipped in egg yolk and rolled in panko crumbs; these arranged in the Calphalon pan and baked. Then later, the whole retrieved from the oven, and the breasts transferred to a plate while we deglaze the pan and concoct the sauce with the chicken broth, wine, butter, etc. Then the chicken is sliced and plated, and the sauce poured over top. Usually one also wants a side dish or two. A number of things can go interestingly wrong in this process, of course, and implementing it would require, among other things, an intelligent management of all the possible mixtures that result.
