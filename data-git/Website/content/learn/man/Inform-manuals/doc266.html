<p>
<p>Ordinarily, if we write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;manipulate [something]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then the &quot;[something]&quot; will only match what is within reach or sight: this is the concept of &quot;scope&quot;, which is what prevents a player from spookily acting on objects from a distance. The parser itself prevents the manipulation rules from ever being invoked on such distant items, which is as it should be.
<p>
<p>Sometimes, though, we positively want to allow this possibility. If we use the special word &quot;any&quot;, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;manipulate [any door]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then any door, anywhere in the model world, can be allowed in the player's command. (Of course, the manipulation rules may not do what the player hopes: all that has happened is that the command is now possible to type.) The &quot;any&quot; can be followed by any description of items or rooms, and the latter opens up new possibilities, since rooms are ordinarily never allowed to be named in the player's commands.
<p>
<p>For example, the following gives the player the ability to walk between rooms without giving explicit directions of movement.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Going by name is an action applying to one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out going by name: say &quot;You walk to [the noun].&quot;; move the player to the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;go to [any adjacent visited room]&quot; as going by name.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(This is really only a sketch: in a finished work, &quot;go to&quot; would produce helpful errors if non-adjacent but visited rooms were named, and we might also worry about rules applying to movement, because the method above will circumvent them.)
