<p>
<p>Like &quot;in&quot;, &quot;nothing&quot; has two slightly different meanings, though here there's much less potential for confusion.
<p>
<p><b>Meaning 1.</b> &quot;Nothing&quot; as &quot;no thing&quot;. This is the meaning in sentences like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a container is bare if nothing is in it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And similar for conditions like &quot;if the box contains nothing&quot;. It's a word which describes the absence of things: it says that, though there might have been many possible items here, it turned out that there were none.
<p>
<p><b>Meaning 2.</b> &quot;Nothing&quot; as a value. This is much less commonly seen, but sometimes Inform stores a value such as a property (or a variable, of which more in later chapters) which always has to be an object. In some circumstances, &quot;nothing&quot; is then a special value meaning that this is not set at present. For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a container is impossible if its matching key is nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;matching key&quot; property of a container is always an object, but is allowed to be &quot;nothing&quot; when there isn't a matching key anywhere. (If such a container is locked, nobody will ever be able to unlock it.)
<p>
<p><b>How Inform decides.</b> So which meaning does Inform use, and when? The answer is that it depends on the relationship being talked about. When this is &quot;is&quot;, values are being compared and we are using meaning 2. But when it is any other relationship, like &quot;is in&quot; - which talks about containment - then we are using meaning 1.
