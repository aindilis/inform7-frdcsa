<p>
<p>Many sections in this book begin by introducing a new kind of value. Reading through in order, the possibilities mount up: numbers, times, texts (and indexed texts), and so on. (See the Kinds page of the Index for a convenient list of the options.) This section is a little different: rather than showing a single new kind of value, it shows how to make a new kind out of any existing one.
<p>
<p>If K is any kind of value, then &quot;list of K&quot; is also a kind of value. For instance, we could write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let L be a list of numbers;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and this would create a new &quot;let&quot; variable, called L, whose kind of value is &quot;list of numbers&quot;. On the other hand, we are not allowed to write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let L be a list;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because &quot;list&quot; by itself is not a kind of value. (Inform always needs to know what kinds the values entered in a list are going to have.)
<p>
<p>Lists are like flexible-length table columns, but that probably makes them sound more mysterious than they really are. A list is simply a sequence of values, called its &quot;entries&quot;, numbered from 1 upwards. The number of entries is called its &quot;length&quot;. If we try
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let L be a list of numbers;
<br>say &quot;L has [the number of entries in L] entries.&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then we find
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">L has 0 entries.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is because all lists start out empty when created: that is, they initially have 0 entries. Inform has two built-in adjectives &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;non-empty&quot; which can apply to lists, and they mean just what they ought to mean: a list is empty if its length is 0, and otherwise non-empty.
<p>
<p>We can add entries very easily:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">add 2 to L; add 3 to L; add 5 to L;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can now, for instance, try saying the list:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;L is now [L].&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>with the result
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">L is now 2, 3 and 5.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that only numbers can be added to L: if we try
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">add &quot;clock&quot; to L;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform will produce a problem message, because L has kind &quot;list of numbers&quot;, whereas &quot;clock&quot; is text. In this way, Inform ensures that a list always contains values of the same kind throughout. So it's not possible to construct a list whose entries are:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">2, &quot;fish&quot;, 4 and the Entire Game
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Such a list would be very hazardous to deal with, in any case. If what we need is a combination of different kinds of values, tables are a better option.
<p>
<p>Finally, note that since &quot;list of numbers&quot; is a kind of value in its own right, so is &quot;list of lists of numbers&quot;, and so on - though such lists are trickier to deal with, they are sometimes handy.
