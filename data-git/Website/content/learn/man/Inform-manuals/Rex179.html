Social Groups</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Crowds of characters introduce new challenges, because we often want to show them interacting with one another, or to describe individuals in less detail when a whole group is present.
<p>
<p><b>Strictly Ballroom</b> gives us a set of characters who pair off each turn, making sure to mention each one once, and leaving one unfortunate person behind as a wallflower: this exemplifies how we might use a behavioral rule not to dictate the behavior of each individual separately but rather to model a whole group together. <b>Happy Hour</b> does calculate movements for characters individually, but then collates the descriptions, creating a single paragraph to describe whatever group is currently in the room.
<p>
<p>Characters can also have complicated attitudes to one another, and it can be helpful to use relations to track these. <b>Unthinkable Alliances</b> demonstrates the grouping of characters into alliance factions, while <b>The Abolition of Love</b> provides a host of relations to track love affairs, marriages, memberships in families, and mere mutual respect.
<p>
<p><b>Emma</b> combines these two effects: its characters move between social groups depending on how they feel about the others in their particular talking circle, and descriptions change depending on who is where in the room.
<p>
<p><b>Lugubrious Pete's Delicatessen</b> simulates a queue at a deli, in which the customers who most impress Pete get served first.

<a name="e179"><a href=Rdoc62.html#e179 STYLE="text-decoration: none">**<b><b>Example</b> 342:  Happy Hour</b></a><br>Listing visible characters as a group, then giving some followup details in the same paragraph about specific ones.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Often it is best to have an entire paragraph about the characters present in a room, but suppose we're narrating a large party with a lot of people moving around. In that case, it might be better to list everyone together, then add a few salient details by way of follow-up, like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Happy Hour&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before listing nondescript items:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can see [a list of people who are marked for listing] here. &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with named party running through people:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the named party is not marked for listing;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let count be the number of visible other people who are carrying something;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if count is 0:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say paragraph break;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let index be count;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with holder running through visible other people who are carrying something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if index is count, say &quot;[The holder]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;[the holder]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot; has [a list of things carried by the holder]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decrement index;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make delimiter index of count.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The next part could be simpler, but for rigor we will write it in such a way that it will work whether or not the serial comma is in use. This requires some extra work; feel free to skip down to the scenario if you prefer.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To make delimiter (index - a number) of (count - a number), continuing or halting:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if index is 0:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if continuing, say &quot;. [run paragraph on]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise if index is 1:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if count is 2, say &quot; and &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;[optional comma] and &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;, &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say optional comma:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if using the serial comma option, say &quot;,&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise do nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now the scene:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Banquet Hall is a room. &quot;A large cheery banner over the door (which, incidentally, vanishes when you approach it) reads: HELLO NEW INDUCTEES! WELCOME TO THE AFTERLIFE!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Fred, George, and Larry are men in the Banquet Hall. Fred carries a dry martini. Larry carries a cream puff. Matilda and Louise are women in the Banquet Hall.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a person is other if it is not the player.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let wanderer be a random other person;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let place be the holder of the wanderer;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let next place be a random room adjacent to the place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the way be the best route from the place to the next place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try the wanderer going the way.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Kitchen is west of the Banquet Hall. &quot;Dominated by a pile of dirty plates which you imagine it will be someone's privilege to wash, later.&quot; Vanessa is a woman in the Kitchen. Vanessa carries a tray. On the tray is a salmon roll. The roll is edible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;z / look / g / g / g &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
