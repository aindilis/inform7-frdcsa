<p>The &quot;device&quot; kind provides for the simplest form of machine: one which is, at any given moment, switched on or switched off. Inform looks after this state, but leaves it to us to make the machine actually do something:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The air-conditioning unit is a device in the Florist's Shop. The air-conditioning is fixed in place and switched on.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when in the Florist's Shop:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the air-conditioning is switched off, say &quot;You worry about the cut flowers in this jungle-hot air.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;There is an low susurration from the air-conditioning unit.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>One primary dictionary definition for a machine is &quot;an apparatus using or applying mechanical power and having several parts&quot;, and we often use the &quot;part of&quot; relationship to build machinery. <b>Control Center</b> provides a neat way to display the component parts of a machine to the player who examines it.
<p>
<p>One component almost always part of an electrical machine is the (literal) switch, lever or button to control whether they are switched on or off. In <b>Model Shop</b> just such an on/off button is automatically made part of every device.
<p>
<p>While an electrical device has only two states, a mechanical machine might have many, and for these the best approach is to define a kind of value naming the possibilities: see <b>Signs and Portents</b>, where the states are the possible destinations pointed towards.
<p>
<p>Perhaps stretching the definition of &quot;machine&quot;, <b>What Makes You Tick</b> demonstrates a fishing pole which the player can put together from several pieces.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Seven Dials is a room. The description of Seven Dials is &quot;There is a signpost, on which seven hands swivel and swing, freely as weathercocks. They make your present road now London, now Abingdon; now Weston-super-Mare, or now Hell.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Seven Dials contains a signpost. The signpost is scenery. Understand &quot;sign&quot; and &quot;post&quot; as the signpost.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Destination is a kind of value. The destinations are London, Abingdon, Luton, Weston-super-Mare, Runnymede, Hell, and Low Noon.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The signpost has a destination.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In order to interact with the signpost, we will need to borrow some action rules from chapter 6:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the signpost:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The signpost] currently puts you on the road to [italic type][the destination of the signpost][roman type], but it swiftly alters again.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the destination of the signpost is the destination after the destination of the signpost.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of turning the signpost:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the destination of the signpost is the destination after the destination of the signpost;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;With a hand's touch you turn the signpost to mark your way for [italic type][the destination of the signpost][roman type].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going north in Seven Dials when the destination of the signpost is Hell:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;It is a path that goes gently ever down and down with no stumbling block or any distraction at either side; there are no bandits and no tolls.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the story.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going north in Seven Dials when the destination of the signpost is Low Noon:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;A long road whose scenery does not change, nor anything on the horizon move but the sun. When at last you come to Noon, she hangs above your head like a hat.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the story finally.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x signpost / n / turn signpost / n / turn signpost / n / turn signpost / n / turn signpost / n&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test more with  &quot;x signpost / n / turn signpost / n / turn signpost / n / turn signpost / n / turn signpost / turn signpost / n&quot;.
