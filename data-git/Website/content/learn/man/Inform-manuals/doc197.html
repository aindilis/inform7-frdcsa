<p>The &quot;photographing&quot; action now works very nicely when the player does it. But not when others try. Suppose that neither the player, nor Clark Gable, is holding the camera:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>photograph clark
<br>You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>clark, photograph me
<br>>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>An uncanny silence. What has happened is that the rules written so far are all implicitly restricted to the player only. This is because when we write -
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check photographing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the camera is not carried:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>the action is &quot;photographing&quot;, not &quot;Clark photographing&quot;. In the next few sections we shall see how to make the rules work nicely for everybody. This is a little bit harder, so it should be noted right away that in many projects there is no need. In a game which has no other characters who succumb to persuasion, for instance, only the player will ever try the action.
