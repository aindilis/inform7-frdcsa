<p>
<p>Since we prefer not to simulate burnt skin, and it is unsporting to kill a player outright merely for touching a hot object, heat is mostly used as a reason why something cannot be picked up at a given moment. This very basic puzzle is demonstrated in <b>Grilling</b>.
<p>
<p>With the naked eye, it is not always easy to detect what is too hot to touch - a point made in both <b>Masochism Deli</b>, where the only solution is to keep picking up potatoes until one doesn't burn, and in <b>Hot Glass Looks Like Cold Glass</b>, where infrared goggles turn the scales.
<p>
<p>If a hot object is not to be touched, will it stay hot forever? It might well, if it is a steak on an electric grill, but not if it is a recently-baked apple pie sitting on a window-sill. <b>Entropy</b> simulates the gradual return of temperature to equilibrium.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Descriptions of objects can be used in &quot;Instead&quot; rules: we can not only say &quot;Instead of taking the steak&quot;, but also &quot;Instead of taking something&quot; or &quot;Instead of taking something which is on the grill&quot;.
<p>
<p>That last rule is useful if, for example, we want to prevent the player from interacting with anything on a specific supporter:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Grilling&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Patio is a room. The Patio contains a grill and an ice chest. The ice chest contains a cold beer. On the grill are a steak and a hot dog.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mom is a woman in the Patio.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking something which is on the grill:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'Hey, you'll burn yourself,' says Mom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;get steak / get all from grill / get all&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We could just as easily adapt this rule to affect a container: &quot;Instead of taking something which is in the ice chest,&quot; for example.
<p>
<p>Note also that in older versions of Inform, the pattern &quot;get all from...&quot; was treated differently from &quot;get steak&quot;, and had to be accounted for separately. This is no longer the case; this instead of taking... rule will handle all the phrasings which the player might use to try to acquire this object.
