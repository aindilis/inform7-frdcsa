<p>
<p>Sometimes it makes sense for the name of something to involve the names of other things to which it is related. For instance, if we say TAKE THE BOTTLE OF WINE, we mean that the bottle currently contains wine - if it were the very same bottle containing water, we would call it something else.
<p>
<p>For names which must involve related names, a special form of token is provided. For instance, we could say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A box is a kind of container. Understand &quot;box of [something related by containment]&quot; as a box.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Toyshop is a room. The red box is a box in the Toyshop. Some crayons are in the red box.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and now TAKE BOX OF CRAYONS will work, because CRAYONS matches against &quot;[something related by containment]&quot; for the red box - or it does for as long as the crayons are there. We can have similar matches against relations of all kinds, but have to name the relation explicitly, using its one-word name. (See the examples at the end of this section for plenty of cases.)
<p>
<p>We can also reverse the sense. If we write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A box is a kind of container. Understand &quot;box in [something related by reversed containment]&quot; as a box.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Toyshop is a room. The crate and the hammock are in the Toyshop. In the crate is a box. In the hammock is a box.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then TAKE THE BOX IN THE HAMMOCK will work: here, the relation goes the other way, because the box is being contained by the other-named item, rather than doing the containing.

<p>
<p>It's fairly common that we want to be able to refer to a container in terms of what it has in it: a bottle of wine, a salt shaker, a chicken sandwich. The player is free to remove the contents again, and the object will go back to using its usual name:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Cinco&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Cinco de Mayo Fundraiser is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The taco shell is an edible thing in the Fundraiser. It is a portable container. It has carrying capacity 1.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;[something related by containment] taco&quot; as the taco.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of the taco shell while not inserting or removing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taco contains something (called filling), say &quot;[filling] taco&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;taco shell&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;omit contents in listing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries shredded beef. It is edible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The taking action has an object called source (matched as &quot;from&quot;).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Setting action variables for taking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now source is the holder of the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report taking something from the taco shell:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You gingerly pick [the noun] out of the taco shell.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x taco / put shredded beef in taco / get taco / i / x shredded beef taco / get shredded beef / x shredded beef taco&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
