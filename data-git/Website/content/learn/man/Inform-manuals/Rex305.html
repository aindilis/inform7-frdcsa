<p>We may want to change the default refusal message when the player tries to pick up scenery: <b>Replanting</b> demonstrates this case simply.
<p>
<p><b>Removal</b> modifies responses to successful TAKE commands, with the effect that when the player picks up an item, he gets a response such as &quot;You take the book from the shelf.&quot;
<p>
<p><b>Croft</b> modifies the DROP command, so that objects dropped on specific surfaces get reported in a special way. <b>Celadon</b> allows the player to drop even objects he is carrying indirectly, for instance on a tray or in a sack.
<p>
<p><b>Morning After</b> introduces a simple rule that changes the behavior of the whole game: whenever the player takes an item he hasn't already looked at, he automatically examines it. This picks up the pace of exploration passages where the player is likely to be collecting a large number of objects.
<p>
<p>By default, when the player tries to put or insert an item that he isn't holding, Inform prints a refusal message; <b>Democratic Process</b> and <b>Sand</b> offer ways instead to have the player first pick up the relevant items. (The former applies to single items the player is trying to place; the latter expands coverage to work even if the player uses a command affecting multiple objects.)
<p>
<p>Taking also happens as a result of other commands. Such takes can be made unnecessary with a procedural rule to turn off the &quot;carrying requirements rule&quot; under particular circumstances, or presented differently using the implicitly taking activity.

<p>&quot;Stop&quot; and &quot;Continue&quot; are most useful when we need to write rules that will have to stop the action some of the time but at other times let it pass; so for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Democratic Process&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before inserting something which is not carried by the player into something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is in the second noun, say &quot;Already done.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(first taking [the noun])[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try taking the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is not holding the noun, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
