Characters Following a Script</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>So far we've seen characters who will answer questions whenever the player feels like asking, and characters who will use some reasoning procedure to direct the conversation. There is a third option, often useful in IF with a fast-paced narrative: the character follows a conversational script, making sure to cover a series of points before the scene ends.
<p>
<p>There are more and less tedious ways to implement this kind of scene. The worst case is one in which the player is not allowed to interrupt or ask any questions; he must merely wait until the character runs out of things to say. This can be useful and plausible in very small doses - say, two or three turns - but if the character has more information than that to impart, we may want to make the scene more interactive.
<p>
<p><b>Pine 2</b> partly addresses this challenge: the character has a line of conversation that she wants to follow to its conclusion; we may ask questions along the way, but if we're silent, she'll take up the slack, and the scene won't end until she's done with what she has to say.
<p>
<p>Another kind of script is a series of actions for the character to perform. <b>Robo</b> demonstrates a programmable robot that will observe what the player does, then try to emulate the actions later when switched into play-back mode. <b>Robo 2</b> extends this capacity to allow the robot to contain fifteen different scripts which the player can store, list, run, and erase.
<p>
<p><b>Your Mother Doesn't Work Here</b> offers a character with a list of tasks but whose plans can be interrupted by more urgent demands. This verges on not being a simple script any more: if we carry the idea to its natural conclusion, we get characters capable of planning scripts for themselves to accomplish their aims. This is conventionally called &quot;goal-seeking&quot;.

<p>

<p>
<p>So much, we had before. Now, suppose we want a conversation style which allows the player to move conversation forward by asking appropriate questions, but which will keep moving forward even if he doesn't. To this end, we provide a table -- a borrowing from a later chapter. In the table, we record two ways of performing each conversation bit, one which reflects the player's participation, and one in which the character moves things onward:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Table of Conversation
<br><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">topic</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">reply</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">quip</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">'Not really,' she replies, edging away from you. So much for that angle.&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;'Ghastly nightmares,' she remarks. You nod politely.&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

'This is a little weird since we just met, but, um. Would you like to get married?'</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">She looks at you nervously. 'Do I have to?'&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;'I, er,' she says. 'I hope I'm not supposed to marry you or something.'&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;marriage/love/wedding/boyfriend/beau/lover&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;'I was told I was going to marry you and inherit the kingdom,' you say, apologetically. 'Would that be very bad?'</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">'Oh, it's not you -- I'm seeing someone,' she says, smiling quickly.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">You try to think how to point out that it's been a hundred years since she last saw her boyfriend.&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;'Do you think I could go look for someone? I'm seeing him, you see, and I think I've been... sick... for a while, so he might be worried.'</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You try to think how to point out that it's been a hundred years since she last saw her boyfriend.&quot;
<br><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;marriage/love/wedding/boyfriend/beau/lover&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;'You've been up here for a hundred years,' you say. An unpleasant thought occurs to you. 'Was your young man in the castle somewhere?'</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">She shakes her head mutely.&quot;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">&quot;She goes to the window and looks out at the now-fading thicket of briar. 'That took a while to grow,' she observes. 'I've been up here longer than I thought.'</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You shrug, uncomfortable.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking an awake beauty about a topic listed in the Table of Conversation:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now Beauty is passive;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[reply entry][paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blank out the whole row.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;now Beauty is passive&quot; line prevents her from making any conversation of her own on a turn when we've spoken to her. This keeps the conversation from progressing too quickly.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of telling an awake beauty about something: try asking the noun about it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking an asleep person about something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] snores.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Marriage Proposal ends when the number of filled rows in the Table of Conversation is 0.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn during Marriage Proposal:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Beauty is active:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat through Table of Conversation:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[quip entry][paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blank out the whole row;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make no decision.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>After we've generated any spontaneous conversation, we return her to her regular active state.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn: now Beauty is active.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Marriage Proposal ends: end the story saying &quot;This is going to take some explaining.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x beauty / wake beauty / pour water on beauty / ask beauty about sleep / z / ask beauty about marriage&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we have a scenario in which the player can ask her some questions out of order if he really wants to, but the scene will not end until the basic conversation topics have been exhausted. If we wanted to add some other chit-chat, not as part of the main conversation strand, but by way of optional enrichment, we might make a second conversation table and record alternative outcomes in it.
