<p>Occasionally we would like to change the way the name of something is printed as part of our inventory, and we can do this with a printing the name rule such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of the dead rat while taking inventory:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;dead rat (at arm's length)&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There are also several possibilities for redesigning the inventory list as a whole. <b>INVENTORY listing with separate carried and worn items</b> shows how to divide an inventory list into two parts, a &quot;You are carrying: &quot; section and a &quot;You are wearing: &quot; section. <b>Equipment List</b> goes further, and shows how we might use Inform's specialized listing functions to create a variety of differently formatted inventories.
<p>
<p>Sometimes the way Inform by default lists properties such as &quot;(closed)&quot; or &quot;(open but empty)&quot; isn't quite what we want. <b>Oyster Wide Shut</b> offers a flexible alternative to the standard behavior, allowing finer control over which properties are listed and how they are described.
<p>
<p><b>Trying Taking Manhattan</b> replaces the inventory behavior for other characters: instead of silently looking through their possessions (but not describing them to the player), they now describe to the player what they're carrying and wearing.

<p>
<p>Inform has built-in commands for other people, and sometimes we may want to adjust the way these work without completely disabling and replacing the command. Suppose, for instance, that instead of
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Kermit the Frog looks through his possessions.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>we'd like someone taking inventory to report what he's got, thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Kermit the Frog says, &quot;I seem to be carrying a microphone and wearing a hat and a trenchcoat.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To do this, we could replace the built-in report rule with a different one.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Trying Taking Manhattan&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The loud inventory rule is listed instead of the report other people taking inventory rule in the report taking inventory rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the loud inventory rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless the player is the person asked:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The person asked] says, 'I seem to be carrying [a list of things carried by the person asked][if the person asked is wearing something] and wearing [a list of things worn by the person asked][end if].'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Persuasion rule for asking someone to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Grand Central Station is a room. &quot;Here you are in New York, New York. Any minute now someone is going to burst into song.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Kermit the Frog is a man in Grand Central Station. &quot;Kermit the Frog stands nearby, enjoying being green.&quot; Kermit is wearing a hat and a trenchcoat. He is carrying a microphone.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;inventory / kermit, inventory&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
