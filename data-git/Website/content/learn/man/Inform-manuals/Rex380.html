<p>The simplest form of clock is a wrist watch. Here is a choice of analogue or digital:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player wears a wrist watch. The description of the wrist watch is &quot;It is [the time of day in words].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player wears a digital watch. The description of the digital watch is &quot;It is [the time of day].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Better clocks would allow us also to set the time, and to stop and start them: see <b>Tom's Midnight Garden</b>.
<p>
<p>Scientific instruments provide sharper versions of our own senses. In the case of vision, they allow us to see closer up, or further away. It's a convention of IF that people can normally see only the current location, that is, they cannot see from one location into another. The boundary of the current room is like a horizon, even out of doors (though it's true that there are ways to disguise that with a continuous outdoor landscape). <b>Ginger Beer</b> provides a telescope able to see into other rooms.
<p>
<p><b>Witnessed 2</b> provides a meter which measures how close a ghost is to the player.

<a name="e380"><a href=Rdoc78.html#e380 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 288:  Tom's Midnight Garden</b></a><br>A clock kind that can be set to any time using "the time understood"; may be turned on and off; and will advance itself only when running. Time on the face is also reported differently depending on whether the clock is analog or digital.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Time can also be understood as a token, and the time parsed will be recorded as &quot;the time understood&quot;. So therefore, if we wish for clocks which may be set:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Tom's Midnight Garden&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A clock is a kind of device. A clock has a time called the current time. A clock can be analog or digital. The current time of a clock is usually 9:01 AM. The description of a clock is &quot;It shows the time to be [if analog]about [the current time to the nearest five minutes in words][otherwise][the current time][end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;set [clock] to [time]&quot; as setting it by time. Setting it by time is an action applying to one thing and one time.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of setting a clock to something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] can be set only to a time of day, such as 8:00 AM, or midnight.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out setting a clock by time:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the current time of the noun is the time understood.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report setting a clock by time:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You set [the noun] to [time understood].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through switched on clocks:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the current time of the item is one minute after the current time of the item.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Hall is a room. The grandfather clock is a fixed in place analog clock in the Hall. The travel clock is a switched on digital clock in the Hall.  When play begins: now the right hand status line is &quot;[time of day]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;examine grandfather clock / set it to midnight / switch it on / wait / wait / wait / examine it / set travel clock to 4:12 / examine it&quot;.
