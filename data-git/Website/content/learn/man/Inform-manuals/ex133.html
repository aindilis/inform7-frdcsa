<p>
<p>Lists are highly adaptable, and many other collection-like constructions can be made using them. This section introduces no new material, but simply suggests some of the variations which are possible.
<p>
<p>1. The traditional computing term <b>array</b> means a list of values accessed by their entry numbers, often used in mathematical computations. The difference between an array and a list is mostly one of attitude, but usually arrays are fixed in length whereas lists can expand or contract.
<p>
<p>2. A <b>log</b> is a list which records the most recently arrived values, but does not allow itself to grow indefinitely. In the following, which remembers the seven most recently taken items, new values arrive at the end while old ones eventually disappear from the front:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The most-recently-taken list is a list of objects that varies.
<br>Carry out taking something (called the item):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truncate the most-recently-taken list to the last 6 entries;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add the item to the most-recently-taken list.
<br>After taking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Taken. (So, your recent acquisitions: [most-recently-taken list].)&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that the most-recently-taken list begins play as the empty list, grows as the first few items are taken, but then stabilises at length 7 thereafter. If we need to remember recent history, but only <i>recent</i> history, then a log is better than a list which can grow indefinitely, because there is no risk of speed reduction or memory exhaustion in a very long game.
<p>
<p>3. A <b>queue</b> is a list of values which are waiting for attention. New values join at the back, while those being dealt with are removed from the front (whereupon the whole queue moves up one). An empty queue means that nobody is waiting for attention: but there is, in principle, no upper limit to the size of a queue, as anyone who has tried to make a couchette reservation at Roma Termini will know.
<p>
<p>Queues typically form when two independent processes are at work, but going at different or variable speeds. An empty queue looks just like any other list:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The queue is a list of objects that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Invariably people, in fact, but lists can only be of kinds of value: so, &quot;list of objects&quot;.) Once we identify a &quot;new customer&quot;, we can join him to the queue thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">add the new customer to the queue;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The process of serving the customers needs to make sure there is actually somebody waiting in the queue before it does anything:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when the number of entries in the queue is not 0:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the next customer be entry 1 of the queue;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The next customer] is served and leaves.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove entry 1 from the queue.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Of course queues can also be constructed which empty from other positions, rather than the front: or we could make what computer scientists sometimes call a <b>deque</b>, a &quot;double-ended queue&quot; where new values arrive at both ends.
<p>
<p>4. A <b>stack</b> is like a queue except that values arrive at, and are removed from, the same end. Stacks are slightly faster if the active end is the back rather than the front, though this will only be noticeable if they grow quite large.
<p>
<p>To put a value V onto a stack S (which is known as &quot;pushing&quot;) is simple:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">add V to S;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And to remove a value from the top of the stack (which is known as &quot;pulling&quot;):
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let N be the number of entries in S;
<br>let V be entry N of S;
<br>remove entry N of S;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that the middle line, accessing entry N, will fail if N = 0, that is, if the stack is empty: Inform's list routines will produce a run-time problem message.
<p>
<p>Stacks are useful if some long-term process is constantly being interrupted by newer and more urgent demands, but they can also be used in planning. If a character has a long-term goal, which needs various short-term goals to be achieved along the way, then a stack can represent the goals currently being pursued. The top of the stack represents what the character is trying to achieve now. If the character realises that it needs to achieve something else first, we put that new goal onto the top of the stack, and it becomes the new current goal. When the character completes a task, it can be removed, and we can go back to trying to finish whatever is now on top. When the stack is empty, the character has achieved the original goal.
<p>
<p>5. Notoriously, <b>set</b> has 464 distinct meanings in the Oxford English Dictionary, making it the single most ambiguous word in the language. Here we mean not the home of a badger or the Egyptian god of the desert, but the mathematical sense: a collection of values (sometimes called &quot;elements&quot;) without duplicates, and which is normally written in brace notation and in some natural order for the reader's convenience.
<p>
<p>The trick here is to maintain the principle that, at all times, our list is sorted in order and contains no duplicates. To provide an example, we start with two sets of numbers:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let S be {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64};
<br>let T be {2, 4, 6, 10};
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here we add an element to T:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">add 8 to T, if absent; sort T;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;if absent&quot; clause ensures that no duplicate can occur, and by sorting T afterwards, we maintain the principle that a set must remain in order - so T is now {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, not {2, 4, 6, 10, 8}. (Inform's sorting algorithm is fast on nearly-sorted lists, so frequent sorting is not as inefficient as it might look.)
<p>
<p>We next take the union of T and S, that is, the set containing everything which is in either or both:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let U be S; add T to U, if absent; sort U;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This makes U = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 16, 32, 64}, and once again no duplicates occur and we preserve the sorting. The intersection of T and S, the set of elements in both of them, is a little trickier:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let I be T;
<br>repeat with the element running through T:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the element is not listed in S, remove the element from I.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Faster methods could be devised which exploit the sortedness of T and S, but are not worth it for shortish lists.) This produces I = {2, 4, 8}. Lastly, we can form the set difference, consisting of those elements which are in S but not in T:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let D be S; remove T from D, if present;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here, as with intersection, since all we do is to strike out unwanted elements, the surviving ones remain in order and there is no need to sort when we are finished. This produces D = {16, 32, 64}.
<p>
<p>6. A <b>sieve</b> is used to make a complicated choice where there are many constraints, by ruling out impossible cases to see what is left. The term derives from the kitchen utensil (for sieving fine grains of flour), but via the name of the &quot;sieve of Eratosthenes&quot;, an ancient Greek method for determining the prime numbers.
<p>
<p>Using a sieve is much like using a set, and the difference is mainly one of outlook - we are interested in what does not belong, rather than what does.
<p>
<p>7. A <b>ring</b> is not so much a row of values, more a circle, with the last and first entries thought of as adjacent. One position is usually thought of as special, and is the place where new items are added: this may as well be entry 1. For instance, to add &quot;new item&quot; to the ring:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">add the item at entry 1 in the ring;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To set &quot;item&quot; to the frontmost value and extract it from the ring:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let the item be entry 1 of the ring;
<br>remove entry 1 from the ring;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And we can rotate the ring in either direction, making a different entry the new entry 1 and therefore the new frontmost value:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">rotate the ring;
<br>rotate the ring backwards;
</font></blockquote><p>

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e133"><a href=doc359.html#e133 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 421:  Eyes, Fingers, Toes</b></a><br>A safe with a multi-number combination, meant to be dialed over multiple turns, is implemented using a log of the last three numbers dialed. The log can then be compared to the safe's correct combination.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>It is not difficult to implement a safe which can be set to a single number to open; but a more common scenario in the real world is for the safe to open on a sequence of numbers when they have been dialed in the right order.
<p>
<p>For IF, this means that we have to keep running track of the last N digits the player has dialed, dropping the first digit and adding a new one to the end each time the player re-dials the safe. This is a perfect occasion for lists:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Eyes, Fingers, Toes&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Addams Wine Cellar is a room. It contains a closed lockable locked container called a safe.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The safe has a list of numbers called the current combination.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The safe has a list of numbers called the true combination. The true combination of the safe is {2, 10, 11}.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;set [something] to [a number]&quot; as setting it numerically to. Setting it numerically to is an action applying to one thing and one number.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the safe:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of entries in the current combination of the safe is 0,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You haven't dialed the safe to any combination yet.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;You have dialed the safe to [the current combination of the safe].&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check setting something numerically to (this is the block setting numerically rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] cannot be set.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of setting the safe numerically to the number understood:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truncate the current combination of the safe to the last 2 entries;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add the number understood to the current combination of the safe;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the safe is locked and the current combination of the safe is the true combination of the safe:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You dial [the number understood], and [the safe] gives a joyous CLICK.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the safe is unlocked;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise if safe is unlocked and the safe is closed and the current combination of the safe is not the true combination of the safe:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You spin the dial, and [the safe] snicks locked.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the safe is locked;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You dial [the number understood] on the safe.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x safe / set safe to 10 / x safe / set safe to 29 / x safe / set safe to 2 / x safe / set safe to 10 / x safe / set safe to 11 / open safe / set safe to 14 / close safe / set safe to 15 / open safe&quot;.
