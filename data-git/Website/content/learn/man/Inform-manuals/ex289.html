<p>
<p>It is quite allowed for a scene to be linked to several other scenes, and this is useful if several alternate strands of plot are being brought together in a common resolution scene:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Bittersweet Ending begins when Stranger's Rejection ends.
<br>Bittersweet Ending begins when Stranger's Acceptance ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and we can also have the same scene beginning when a condition holds. In general, it will begin the first time it gets any chance to do so.
<p>
<p>All scenes are ordinarily set up so that they can happen only once. But sometimes we want them to repeat. Suppose the train calls not once only, but every twenty minutes. We could set this up with two scenes linked back to back like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Train Stop is a recurring scene. Train Wait is a recurring scene.
<br>Train Wait begins when play begins.
<br>Train Stop begins when Train Wait ends.
<br>Train Wait begins when Train Stop ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The difference here is that these scenes have been declared as &quot;recurring&quot;. In all other respects they are the same as any other scene.

<p>This is mostly a repeat of what we have already seen, but for the sake of producing a playable scenario, we include it. The new material appears at Part 2.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So far we haven't much of a chance to affect matters and make them better. Suppose we'd like to add an element to the conversation where we're allowed to tell Beauty about past events -- and explore them a bit; and if the first retelling doesn't go quite as planned, we're allowed to revisit these scenes to hit them with a bit more emphasis.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Part 2 - Flashbacks

<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A fact is a kind of thing. The family circumstances is a fact. A fact can be known or unknown. A fact can be current or past.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Once known, a fact remains known permanently -- this could be useful if we wanted to make some rules about how Beauty acts when she knows different information. By contrast, a fact is only &quot;current&quot; if it is the last thing discussed. Since a player can mention a fact over and over, he can make it &quot;current&quot; again and again, and thus reactivate the flashback.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Table of Flashback Material

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> After printing the name of a fact (called target): now the target is current; now the target is known.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This &quot;After printing the name...&quot; rule will be explained later in the chapter on activities; for now, it is enough to know that whenever family circumstances is mentioned in the table of flashback material, this rule will automatically be called. Now the terms under which the flashback happens:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Poverty flashback is a recurring scene. Poverty flashback begins when family circumstances is current. When poverty flashback begins: strip the player; move the player to the Woodcutter's Shack.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note the &quot;recurring&quot; here: we want the player to be able to revisit this scene as needed.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Woodcutter's Shack is a room. &quot;Your family lives in a shack in the forest. There are holes in the roof, and in the winter the snow comes in -- rain, too, for that matter. The walls aren't very well-boarded, and don't keep out the wind, and even though you live in the middle of dense woods, you can never gather enough fuel to keep this place fully heated. And then there's the stench. Pigs wander freely in and out, and your three youngest brothers play on the floor.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Pigs are an animal in the shack. The pigs are scenery. The description is &quot;They really are very grubby, dirty animals, but what's worse than that, the value of pigs has declined a lot over the last few decades. This is hard to explain to someone who has been out of touch with the world for a while, but keeping pigs for meat is a dubious prospect when there's less and less for them to forage on.&quot; Instead of smelling the pigs: say &quot;They smell the way animals do, when they live among their own refuse.&quot;; increase the pity of Beauty by 2.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The brothers are a man. The description of brothers is &quot;Hans, Franz, and Lukas. Twins and then the baby. So young, and growing up fatherless; and soon to be orphaned entirely, if your mother's health does not improve.&quot; Understand &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;twin&quot; or &quot;twins&quot; or &quot;baby&quot; or &quot;franz&quot; or &quot;hans&quot; or &quot;lukas&quot; as the brothers.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The untidy bed is scenery in the Shack. Mother is a woman on the untidy bed. The description of mother is &quot;She is wasting away of a slow disease, her skin stretched tautly over bone. She hasn't been the same since your father left.&quot; On the bed is a folded letter.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the letter is &quot;Many times read over and creased, the letter explains how your father has gone away with a wealthy countess and will not return. Your mother was not able to read it herself, of course, and had to have it explained to her by the parish priest. Now she keeps it by the bed and crumples it in her fits of delirium.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of kissing or touching Mother for the first time:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You place a gentle kiss on her feverish brow. She looks up at you, her oldest -- yes, never mind that bit -- with a look of sincere trust and admiration.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">'You'll find a way through this for us,' she says, squeezing your fingers. 'I know you will.'&quot;; increase the pity of Beauty by 3.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of kissing Mother: say &quot;You have no more heart-rending memories of affection to recount; that one incident will have to serve, for rhetorical purposes.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting in the Shack: say &quot;The wind blows sharply through the walls.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of attacking someone in the Shack:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Though sometimes the conditions of your life make you grouchy and impatient, you would never dream of striking a member of your own family. But from time to time you do feel the temptation.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Beauty has a number called pity. After examining something in the Woodcutter's Shack, increment the pity of Beauty. After examining mother, increase the pity of Beauty by 2. After examining the letter, increase the pity of Beauty by 3.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Poverty flashback ends when waiting or the time since poverty flashback began is five minutes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Poverty flashback ends:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now family circumstances is past;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;...you finish describing the miserable circumstances of your home life, and allow your attention to return to the present.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restore the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now Beauty is passive;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Beauty is sympathetic, say &quot;'Oh dear!' she says. 'What a dreadful life!' She wrings her hands. 'No wonder you are eager to improve your lot...! But --' Her brow clears, a new thought occurring. 'You needn't marry me, you know! We could arrange it differently! I am certain that my father would give you a large reward, instead, and then I would not be separated from my current boyfriend!'&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;She makes a disgusted face, but she doesn't seem nearly so heart-wrung as you had hoped to make her. Tough audience, these modern princesses.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: Beauty is sympathetic if the pity of Beauty is greater than 4.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say attitude:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Beauty is sympathetic, say &quot;distressed on your behalf&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;a little confused&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And the following is the same as in the Space Patrol example as well: we need a systematic way to remove the player's possessions, then put everything back when the flashback is over:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Saved location is a room that varies. Locker is a container. Wardrobe is a container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To strip the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now every thing carried by the player is in the locker;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every thing worn by the player is in the wardrobe;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now saved location is location.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To restore the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every thing carried by the player is in the location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every thing in the locker is carried by the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every thing in the wardrobe is worn by the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the player to saved location.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x beauty / wake beauty / pour water on beauty / ask beauty about sleep / tell beauty about poverty / smell pigs / x mother / x letter / kiss mother / ask beauty about marriage / z / z&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Because we haven't changed the endings of the &quot;Marriage Proposal&quot; scene, there is still only one way for this scenario to work out; but at least now the player has the opportunity to alter Beauty's attitude a bit (or not) before the game is done.
