<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> Whenever the name of a thing or room is printed.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> For items other than the current player, the &quot;printed name&quot; property is printed out; but for the current player, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;yourself&quot; is printed. (That doesn't necessarily mean that the &quot;printed name&quot; of the player is never used. Suppose there are two people, Alice and Bob, and the narrative switches between them: when Alice is the player, she appears as &quot;yourself&quot; but Bob is &quot;Bob&quot;; but when Bob is the player, he is &quot;yourself&quot; and Alice is &quot;Alice&quot;.)
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) A pen which is described differently in inventories:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of the pen while taking inventory: say &quot;useful pen&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Taking inventory&quot; is a condition which is true if that's the current action and not otherwise, so the effect is that the pen is called &quot;a useful pen&quot; only in inventory listings. &quot;While looking&quot; is a similarly useful one.
<p>
<p>(b) Italicising the names of novels:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A novel is a kind of thing. Dr Zhivago and Persuasion are novels. Before printing the name of a novel, say &quot;[italic type]&quot;. After printing the name of a novel, say &quot;[roman type]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(c) Telling the time:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the name of the wrist watch while taking inventory: say &quot; (time: [the time of day])&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(d) Merging containers with their contents:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of the bottle while not inserting or removing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the bottle contains sand, say &quot;bottle of sand&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;empty bottle&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;omit contents in listing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This example makes use of a special phrase:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>omit contents in listing</b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_omit -->

<p>This phrase changes the form of an inventory listing, room description, etc., so that it will simply list &quot;a bottle of sand&quot; or &quot;an empty bottle&quot;, rather than &quot;a bottle (in which is sand)&quot; or &quot;a bottle (which is empty)&quot;. It should be used only when the listing is imminent, and does not have permanent effect.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>The clause about not inserting or removing is to prevent messages like &quot;You put the sand in the bottle of sand.&quot;, where it's confusing to refer to the bottle as anything other than &quot;the bottle&quot;.

<a name="e78"><a href=doc291.html#e78 STYLE="text-decoration: none">****<b><b>Example</b> 328:  Chronic Hinting Syndrome</b></a><br>Using name-printing rules to keep track of whether the player knows about objects, and also to highlight things he might want to follow up.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we have a conversation system in which it is important to keep track of which subjects the player has heard mentioned. If we're careful to mark subjects in brackets, we can use the &quot;printing the name of&quot; activity to record which things have been mentioned so far:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Chronic Hinting Syndrome&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A subject is a kind of thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Knowledge relates various people to various subjects. The verb to know (it knows, they know, it is known) implies the knowledge relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Awareness relates various people to various subjects. The verb to be aware of implies the awareness relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a subject is pending if the player is aware of it and it is not known by the player.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of thinking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of pending subjects is 0, say &quot;You have no fresh leads at the moment.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;You recall that thus far you have not followed up with questions about [the list of pending subjects].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the name of a subject (called idea):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player is aware of the idea.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now suppose that as an added convenience for the player, we let him turn on a mode in which useful conversation topics are always automatically highlighted in the text, so he doesn't waste his time trying to follow up dead leads:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Setting is a kind of value. The settings are bright and dull. Understand &quot;on&quot; as bright. Understand &quot;off&quot; as dull.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Highlighting is a setting that varies. Highlighting is dull.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;highlighting [setting]&quot; as setting highlighting. Setting highlighting is an action out of world, applying to one setting.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out setting highlighting:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now highlighting is the setting understood.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report setting highlighting:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Highlighting is now [if highlighting is dull]off[otherwise]on[end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before printing the name of a subject (called idea) when highlighting is bright:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless the player knows the idea:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[bold type]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the name of a subject when highlighting is bright:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[roman type]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...And the rest is peripheral.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Sickbay is a room. &quot;A place arranged for Nathan's comfort, since his sickness has been prolonged and because he becomes so irritating when not comfortable.&quot; The Hallway is outside from the Sickbay.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A supporter can be untried or rejected. A supporter is usually untried.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Sickbay contains a wobbly pedestal, a table, and a sickbed. Understand &quot;bed&quot; as the sickbed. The pedestal, the table, and the sickbed are supporters. Nathan is a man on the sickbed. The sickbed is scenery. The initial appearance of the wobbly pedestal is &quot;A wobbly pedestal near the door has sometimes been known to support vases of flowers, but is currently bare.&quot; The initial appearance of the table is &quot;There is also a table of a more ordinary sort.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Nathan can be active or passive.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the name of Nathan: now Nathan is passive.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of putting the sculpture on the table:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the table is rejected;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'[Not there],' [Nathan] snaps. 'The table is way too far from the sickbed.'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of putting the sculpture on the sickbed:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the sickbed is rejected;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'[Not there],' [Nathan] rebukes you. 'You don't want me knocking it over if I roll around. In pain.'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of putting the sculpture on the pedestal:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the pedestal is rejected;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The pedestal starts to wobble so ominously that you don't dare let go.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">'[Not there],' says [Nathan]. 'That thing is falling apart.'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before putting something on the down: try dropping the noun instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say not there:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if all the supporters are rejected:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Look, the floor would be fine&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise if the number of rejected supporters is 1:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Yeah, anywhere but there, I'm afraid&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Come on, use your head -- I can't be watching you all the time, I'm sick&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going outside when the player is carrying the sculpture:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You've still got this sculpture to get rid of.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going outside when the breakage is pending:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can't very well smash in front of [Nathan] his prize sculpture and then just scamper off without saying something. Appealing though the thought is at the moment.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going outside when a subject which is not the breakage is pending:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'Yeah, go ahead,' says [Nathan], with a martyr-like air. 'It's probably best that you don't hear about [the random pending subject]. It's not something I'd go into normally.'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The breakage is a subject. The description is &quot;It's not a big deal. I'll just buy a new [mental wave generator].' A slight awkward pause. 'I mean, this one was a [gift], but don't worry about it&quot;. Understand &quot;accident&quot; or &quot;smashing&quot; or &quot;breaking&quot; or &quot;shard&quot; or &quot;mishap&quot; or &quot;shards&quot; or &quot;mistake&quot; as the breakage. Understand &quot;sculpture&quot; as the breakage when the player is not carrying the sculpture.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of saying sorry in the presence of Nathan when the player is aware of the breakage:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try asking Nathan about the matter of breakage.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking Nathan to try saying sorry when the player is aware of the breakage:

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The dreams is a subject. The description is &quot;They're not the kind of dream you want to have.' He closes his eyes and contemplates these undesirable dreams. 'Have you ever woken up convinced you were dead? No, probably not. Well... At any rate, I need the [generator]. Oh, don't worry, they're expensive but not so expensive that I won't be able to save up for another, in a few months&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The gift is a subject. The description is &quot;[The mental wave generator] was a present from a girl named [Shari]. Actually I'm not sure she'd take to being called a girl&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Shari is a subject. The description is &quot;Look, let's just not go into it, okay? I don't really want to relive all that right now. I still have a six-inch [scar] shaped like a banana in the middle of my back&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The scar is a subject.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking Nathan about the matter of the scar:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Nathan clears his throat, lowers his voice, and begins to tell you the story...&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the story saying &quot;End of Demo -- Register to Continue!!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player knows the second noun, say &quot;You've already covered that. The response was '[description of the second noun].'&quot; instead.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'Just put that down anywhere,' says [Nathan], as you come into the room. He's sitting in the sickbed with his legs straight out in front of him. 'I don't care where.' His voice is weak, but it sharpens up for the last remark: 'And don't make a lot of noise about it.'
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Considering that he woke you from a sound slumber to beg you to bring this thing over, his attitude is a bit much. You stare dubiously at the awkward crystal sculpture in your hands.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now Nathan knows every subject.

<p>
