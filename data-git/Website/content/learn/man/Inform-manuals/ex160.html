<p>
<p>When testing conditions, we normally talk only about specific things, or else ask if a particular circumstance happens:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the oaken door is open
<br>if a woman is carrying an animal
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But we can also use &quot;all&quot;, &quot;each&quot; or &quot;every&quot; to check the whole range:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if each door is open
<br>if anyone is carrying all of the animals
<br>if everybody is in the Dining Room
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform allows other English &quot;determiners&quot; (as they are sometimes called), as well:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if some of the doors are open
<br>if most of the doors are open
<br>if almost all of the doors are open
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>are true if at least one case is true, if a majority (any number greater than one half) or at least 80 per cent of the possible cases are true, respectively.
<p>
<p>And we can also use &quot;none&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. These three are all ways to say the same thing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if no door is open
<br>if all of the doors are not open
<br>if none of the doors is open
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>though it may be clearer style to find a positive way of putting things:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if all of the doors are closed
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>All, each and every can be applied to values, too - but only in some cases. For example, suppose we write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. A colour can be found or unfound.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And suppose that, during play, we assign the &quot;found&quot; property to any colour which the player notices on a wall. We might then want to write conditions like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if every colour is found
<br>if most of the colours are found
<br>if any colour is found
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But we always have to bear in mind that Inform might have no reasonable way to decide these questions. It will refuse to allow these, for example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if every number is positive
<br>if any text is palindromic
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(even supposing the adjective &quot;palindromic&quot; has been defined) - there are practically infinitely many possible numbers and texts, so the search cannot sensibly be done.

<a name="e160"><a href=doc100.html#e160 STYLE="text-decoration: none">****<b><b>Example</b> 82:  Revenge of the Fussy Table</b></a><br>A small game about resentful furniture and inconvenient objects.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>This example does include a number of features that we haven't met yet, particularly rulebooks. Nonetheless, the basic idea should be relatively clear. Our premise is that the player is faced with a series of disgruntled furnishings, none of which want to be responsible for supporting the cold, hot, drippy, or spiky objects lying around the room.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Revenge of the Fussy Table&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 1 - The Supporters
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Dining Room is a room. &quot;A room of handsome proportions, with an octagonal dining table on a fine parquet floor. The original set of chairs has been taken away, leaving only a red velvet dining chair and a blue suede armchair.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The fussy table is a supporter in the Dining Room. It is scenery. The description is &quot;It's hypochondriac: the result of a sojourn in a superior antique shop, where it picked up the scent of almond oil, words like provenance, and a secretive shame about being resurfaced.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Chairs don't get along with it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In its mellowest moods, after a really good dusting, it will mention, casually, a cabinet it once knew, which was twelve feet tall, came from the Winter Palace, and had an asking price of $350K.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A chair is a kind of supporter with carrying capacity 1. A chair is enterable. A chair is usually scenery. Understand &quot;chair&quot; as a chair.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The blue suede armchair and the red velvet dining chair are chairs in the Dining Room. The description of the blue suede is &quot;Quiet, mellow, and with a lingering aroma of clove cigarettes, and possibly something less legal. It doesn't sit up straight, and doesn't let anyone else do so either.&quot; The red velvet has the description &quot;In temperament, in bearing, in everything it is the opposite of the blue suede chair. It is concerned for its duty all the time, has a rigidly straight back, and pokes diners in the spine when it suspects them of overdoing things.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The carrying capacity of the player is 2.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 2 - Sources of Unpleasantness
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be drippy or dry.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Heat is a kind of value. The heats are luke-warm, cold, and scalding. Everything has a heat. Understand the heat property as describing a thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be spiky or smooth. The cleated left shoe is a wearable spiky thing. It is worn by the player. The cleated right shoe is a wearable spiky thing. It is worn.

<p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After putting a cold thing on a scalding thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] meets [the second noun]; both shriek in pain. But the necessary heat transfer occurs.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the heat of the noun is luke-warm;

<p>
<p>Moreover, every time the player gets close to resolving this issue, his unhelpful companion Alison brings in something else inconvenient. We can use the counting of contented supporters to decide when the player is getting close to winning and it's time for her to bring something else...
