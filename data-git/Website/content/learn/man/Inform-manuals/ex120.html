<p>
<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> Just <i>before</i> writing a paragraph about some item in a room description.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> Is to do nothing. However, if a rule is supplied which prints something up, then this replaces the paragraph which would otherwise have been printed. Moreover, any items whose names are said in the course of this rule - for instance, by being listed - are then excluded from the remainder of the room description, because they are considered as having been described sufficiently already.
<p>
<p>Warning: because we often want a &quot;for&quot; rule for this activity to make some calculation and then possibly choose to do nothing (see the example &quot;Otranto&quot;), Inform suppresses the usual paragraph not when a &quot;for&quot; rule took effect but when it detected a paragraph having been printed. This can get confused if a text substitution affecting paragraph breaks, say &quot;[line break]&quot;, is within the final &quot;say&quot; of a &quot;for writing a paragraph about&quot; rule.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) This is a neat way to wrap several things together into the same paragraph:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Mr Wickham:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Mr Wickham looks speculatively at [list of women in the location].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because now &quot;Mr Wickham looks speculatively at Velma and Daphne&quot; will now prevent the appearance of the subsequent text &quot;You can also see Velma and Daphne.&quot;
<p>
<p>Inform keeps track of which objects have already been named with an either/or property called &quot;mentioned&quot;, which it assigns whenever the name of an object has been automatically printed. So in this case, Velma and Daphne are now mentioned. Note &quot;automatically printed&quot;, though: if the text printed had just been &quot;Mr Wickham looks speculatively at Velma and Daphne&quot;, rather than the text-substitution list used above, then Inform would not know that Velma and Daphne have been described.
<p>
<p>If we ever need to override this - say, we want to list all the women but make sure that Velma gets another paragraph anyway - we could change Velma to unmentioned again after the listing.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->

<p>
<p>To start with, let's understand &quot;room&quot; to mean &quot;a group of people talking&quot;. These groups can grow and shrink as people come and go, so we'll want to name and rename them; and we're also going to need some rules to motivate people moving around, and a description to narrate how they behave when we're with them.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Emma&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">by the banquet table is a room. at the corner is a room. next to the doorway is a room. by the window is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Social clump is a kind of value. The social clumps are vacancy, lone person, couple, cluster, group.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A room has a social clump. Understand the social clump property as describing a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before printing the name of a room:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;a [social clump] &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After looking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assign clumping;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Elsewhere in the room, you can see [the list of rooms which are not the location].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;go to [any room]&quot; as joining. Joining is an action applying to one visible thing. Carry out joining: move player to the noun. Report joining: do nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;examine [any room]&quot; as looking toward. Looking toward is an action applying to one visible thing. Carry out looking toward a room: say &quot;In that direction you see [a list of other people in the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: assign clumping. Every turn: assign clumping.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To assign clumping:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with space running through rooms:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the social clump of the space is vacancy;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the space contains more than 2 people and the space contains fewer than 5 people, now the social clump of the space is cluster;

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The room description heading rule is not listed in the carry out looking rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person has a number called longevity. The longevity of a person is usually 0. A person can be active or passive.

<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the mover to the destination;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the mover likes the figure, increment attractiveness of the space;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the mover dislikes the figure, decrement attractiveness of the space;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the mover desires the figure, increase attractiveness of the space by 2.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Weston, Mr Woodhouse, Mr Elton, Mr Knightley, and Frank Churchill are men. Mrs Weston, Mrs Bates, Miss Bates, Harriet Smith, Emma Woodhouse, and Jane Fairfax are women.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move character to space.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now we use writing a paragraph about... to describe character behavior in groups, when we join them:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Frank Churchill:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location contains a woman (called flirt) who is desired by Frank:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[Frank Churchill] is talking with great animation and slightly more than becoming warmth to [the flirt][if an unmentioned other person is in the location], while [the list of unmentioned other people in the location] look on with varying degrees of amusement or irritation[end if].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with character running through people in the location:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the character is not Churchill and the character is not the flirt, now the character is bored.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Mr Elton:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location contains an unmentioned woman (called flirt) who is desired by Elton:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[Mr Elton] hangs on the sleeve of [the flirt], offering an assortment of studied gallantries that make you wonder about his good sense.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with character running through people in the location:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the character is not Elton and the character is not the flirt, now the character is bored.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Harriet Smith:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location contains Emma and Emma is unmentioned:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[Harriet] and [Emma] are conversing in low tones -- Harriet, apparently, being too shy to speak so that everyone can hear her.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Mr Knightley:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location contains an unmentioned man (called the listener) who is not Mr Knightley:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[Mr Knightley] is speaking with [the listener] about agricultural matters.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the listener is complacent.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about Miss Bates:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[Miss Bates] is giggling about the weather[if an unmentioned other person is in the location]. This does not seem to compel the interest of [the list of unmentioned other people in the location][end if].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with character running through people in the location:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the character is not Miss Bates and character is not Mrs Bates, now the character is bored.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Since this is just an example, we'll stop here, but there's no reason we couldn't write such paragraphs for everyone.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;z / z / z / look / x corner / x doorway / x window / x table / go to the table&quot;.
