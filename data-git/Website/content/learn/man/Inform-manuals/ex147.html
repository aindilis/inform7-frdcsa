<p>
<p>The main title of the map is the value of &quot;title&quot; for the whole map, so for instance we might write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Index map with title set to &quot;Oxford and its Environs&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The subtitle settings apply to the subtitles used for each of the levels, so for instance
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Index map with subtitle of level -1 set to &quot;Tunnels and Sewers&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Names of individual rooms can be controlled with:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Index map with name of Radcliffe Camera set to &quot;Library&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(By default, the name of a room is its name in the main IF project, of course.) The smallest writing on the map is normally that used to label unorthodox or unclear exits (in particular, those going from one layer to another): this is what the &quot;annotation&quot; size, font and colour are used for.
<p>
<p>For most ways to set up the map, it's a practical necessity to abbreviate names of rooms, or they will spill out all over each other. Inform does this using the &quot;room-name-length&quot; setting. (The &quot;annotation-name-length&quot; is analogous.) For instance, if this setting is 5, then Inform will reduce the text of a name to at most 5 characters. It does this by successively throwing out spaces, lower case vowels, then other lower case letters, punctuation marks and finally upper case letters, always starting at the back of the name and working inwards: the process stops as soon as the name is short enough. For instance, &quot;Reading&quot; is abbreviated to &quot;Redng&quot;, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; to &quot;Shn-La&quot; and &quot;Cloud-Cuckoo-Land&quot; to &quot;C-C-L&quot;. The result can be a little comical, but is surprisingly unambiguous in practice. Abbreviation can effectively be abolished by raising the &quot;room-name-length&quot; to 128 (the highest permitted level), and note that the setting can be changed for individual rooms, so it is possible to have some room names abbreviated and others not, or in different degrees.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e147"><a href=doc405.html#e147 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 435:  Baedeker</b></a><br>Creating a floorplan of the cathedral using the locations from previous examples.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>If our map is largely or entirely set inside a single building, we might want to produce something that resembles a floorplan. It's possible to do this with a little tweaking, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Baedeker&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Dome is a room. North of Dome is North Chapel. South of the Dome is South Chapel. West of the Dome is Western End. Quiet Corner is northwest of the Dome, north of Western End, and west of North Chapel. Loud Corner is east of North Chapel, northeast of Dome, and north of Eastern End. Eastern End is north of Dim Corner and east of Dome. Dim Corner is southeast of Dome and east of South Chapel. Ruined Corner is southwest of Dome, west of South Chapel, and south of Western End.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The church door is east of Eastern End and west of the Courtyard. The church door is a door.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Index map with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-shape set to &quot;square&quot; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-size set to 60 and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-name-size set to 9 and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-name-length set to 13 and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;route-thickness set to 20 and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-outline set to off and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;map-outline set to off and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;route-colour set to &quot;White&quot; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-colour set to &quot;White&quot; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-shape of Dome set to &quot;circle&quot; and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room-size of Dome set to 80 and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EPS file.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we have a map made of white lines and boxes over a white background, which is not very exciting. If, however, we put a layer of black under this and slightly adjust the room shapes (using an image editor such as Adobe Illustrator), we can produce something that plausibly resembles a floorplan or museum map, like so:
<p>
<p><img border=0 src=images/Sophia.jpg>
