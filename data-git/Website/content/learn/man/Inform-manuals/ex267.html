Understanding kinds of value</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>In many cases, if K is the name of a kind of value, then Inform automatically makes an Understand token called &quot;[K]&quot; which matches only values of K. An example is &quot;[number]&quot;, which matches text like 203 or SEVEN. There is a chart of the kinds of value in the Kinds index for a project, showing which ones can be understood in this way.
<p>
<p>In particular, any newly created kind of value can always be understood. We make good use of that in the example game &quot;Studious&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Studious&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Studio is a room. &quot;The unreal world of the photographic studio, full of fake furniture, cantilevered stands and silver-white shades like miniature parachutes.&quot; The lumpy black camera is in the Studio. &quot;A lumpy black camera hangs from a tripod.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The rake-thin model is a woman in the Studio. &quot;A rake-thin model, exquisitely bored and boringly exquisite, angles herself indolently.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Limb is a kind of value. The limbs are left leg, left arm, right leg and right arm.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Detailing is an action applying to one limb and one visible thing, requiring light. Check detailing: if the camera is not carried then say &quot;You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?&quot; instead. Report detailing: say &quot;Click! You take a detail photograph of the [limb understood] of [the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;photograph [limb] of [a person]&quot; as detailing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;get camera / photograph left leg of model&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note the way we can refer to the limb mentioned by the player as the &quot;limb understood&quot;. Similarly, we could talk about the &quot;number understood&quot; if the value parsed had been a number, and so on.
<p>
<p>One of the built-in kinds of value is worth special note: time. A time can hold either a specific time of day, such as 10:23 PM, or a duration of something, such as 21 minutes. The &quot;[a time]&quot; token matches times of day, such as 10:15 AM or MIDNIGHT. But 10 MINUTES wouldn't be recognised by &quot;[a time]&quot; since it isn't a specific moment in the day. To get around this, an alternative version called &quot;[a time period]&quot; is available. So:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;wait for [a time period]&quot; as ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>would match WAIT FOR AN HOUR or WAIT FOR TWO HOURS 12 MINUTES.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e267"><a href=doc268.html#e267 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 292:  Pages</b></a><br>A book with pages that can be read by number (as in "read page 3 in...") and which accepts relative page references as well (such as "read the last page of...", "read the next page", and so on).<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we have a book that the player must consult page-by-page, and we want to be able to accept all of the following input:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">> READ BOOK (to choose a random page and read it)
<br>> READ PAGE 1 IN BOOK
<br>> READ PAGE 2
<br>> READ THE LAST PAGE OF THE BOOK
<br>> READ THE NEXT PAGE
<br>> READ PREVIOUS PAGE IN BOOK
<br>> READ THE FIRST PAGE
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>One approach would be to write many different understand rules and actions: one action for reading randomly, one for reading a specific page, one for reading the first page, one for reading the previous page, one for reading the next page, and one for reading the last page. But this gets tedious to construct and maintain.
<p>
<p>More usefully, we could consider that all of the last four options are essentially the same action at heart: the player is asking to read a page in the book using a name rather than a number, and we will have to perform a minor calculation to discover what the number should be. Here's an implementation using named values to resolve this problem:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;Pages&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Library is a room. The sinister book is carried by the player. The sinister book has a number called the last page read. The sinister book has a number called the length. The length of the sinister book is 50.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the command &quot;read&quot; as something new.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;read [something]&quot; or &quot;consult [something]&quot; or &quot;read in/from [something]&quot; as reading. Reading is an action applying to one thing, requiring light.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;read [number] in/from/of [something]&quot; or &quot;read page [number] in/from/of [something]&quot; or &quot;look up page [number] in/from/of [something]&quot; or &quot;consult page [number] in/from/of [something]&quot; as reading it in. Reading it in is an action applying to one number and one thing, requiring light.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Named page is a kind of value. The named pages are first page, last page, next page, previous page.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is the effective value of (L - last page):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on the length of the book.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is the effective value of (F - first page):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on 1.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is the effective value of (N - next page):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let X be the last page read of the book plus 1;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on X.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is the effective value of (P - previous page):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let X be the last page read of the book minus 1;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on X.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;read [named page] in/from/of [something]&quot; or &quot;read the [named page] in/from/of [something]&quot; as reading it relatively in. Reading it relatively in is an action applying to one named page and one thing, requiring light.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Does the player mean reading something in the sinister book: it is very likely.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the book requirement rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is not carrying the sinister book, say &quot;You're not reading anything.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check reading it relatively in:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is not the sinister book, say &quot;There are no pages in [the second noun].&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abide by the book requirement rule.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out reading it relatively in:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let N be the effective value of the named page understood;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the number understood is N;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try reading N in the book.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check reading it in:
