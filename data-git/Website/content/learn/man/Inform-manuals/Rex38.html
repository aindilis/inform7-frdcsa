<p>
<p>Talking about characters presents some special challenges. For one thing, some characters are referred to by a proper name, but others are not: so the game might want to talk about &quot;Jack&quot; but also about &quot;the drunk pedestrian&quot;. In the absence of other information, Inform attempts to divine our intentions based on the words with which we defined a new character: but we can always override its guess with an explicit statement, such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Great Malefactor is proper-named.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p><b>Belfry</b> demonstrates further how titles are set at the start of play.
<p>
<p>The relation between the player and the other characters is not always static, however. Sometimes we want the player to learn a character's name part-way through play, and start referring to &quot;the drunk pedestrian&quot; as &quot;Fernando&quot;. Similarly, the status of another character may change due to some twist of the plot. <b>Gopher-wood</b> shows how to change the name of a character mid-game, and <b>Peers</b> handles changing the character's rank.
<p>
<p>Alternatively, of course, the player character may already know some of the other characters when the game begins, even if the player does not. In that case, we may want to add a tag-line or so of identification to a character's name when he first appears in the game. <b>A Humble Wayside Flower</b> shows one way of doing this.
<p>
<p>Another occasional challenge is dealing with such commands as EXAMINE DR. THISBY. The problem here is that Inform by default will understand the full stop after &quot;Dr&quot; to be the end of one command and the beginning of another, and will try to interpret &quot;Thisby&quot; as a verb. If we do have a game populated by such formally-addressed characters, we may turn to Punctuation Removal, which provides a phrase to remove the full stops in standard titles before attempting to interpret the command.
<p>
<p>Other characters have physical characteristics as well as names, of course, and <b>Meet Market</b> demonstrates one way of implementing people with notable features.
<p>
<p>Finally, in some IF, the roles of characters may change from playing to playing. If we are writing a replayable murder mystery, we might want to select a new culprit each time the game starts; for this, see <b>Clueless</b>.

<a name="e38"><a href=Rdoc47.html#e38 STYLE="text-decoration: none">***<b><b>Example</b> 237:  A Humble Wayside Flower</b></a><br>Relations track the relationships between one character and another. Whenever the player meets a relative of someone he already knows, he receives a brief introduction.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>First we define the relationships we choose to acknowledge:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;A Humble Wayside Flower&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Marriage relates one person to another (called the spouse). The verb to be married to implies the marriage relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Fatherhood relates one person (called father) to various people. The verb to engender (he engenders, they engender) implies the fatherhood relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For brevity, we will ignore the existence of mothers. It is a sad world.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Siblinghood relates a person (called A) to a person (called B) when a person who engenders A engenders B. The verb to be sibling to implies the siblinghood relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Family relates a person (called A) to a person (called B) when A is married to B or A engenders B or B engenders A or A is sibling to B. The verb to be related to implies the family relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person can be known or unknown. After printing the name of an unknown person (called the alien):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a known person (called the contact) is related to the alien:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot; ([relation between alien and contact] of [the contact])&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the alien is known;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say relation between (first party - a person) and (second party - a person):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the first party is married to the second party:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the first party is female, say &quot;wife&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;husband&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the first party is sibling to the second party:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the first party is female, say &quot;sister&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;brother&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the first party engenders the second party:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;father&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second party is the father of the first party:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the first party is female, say &quot;daughter&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;son&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Pere Blanchard's Hut is a room. Percival Blakeney is a known man in the Hut. Marguerite is a woman in the Hut. Percival is married to Marguerite. Outside from the Hut is the Garden. Louise is a woman in the Garden. The Road to Paris is west of the Garden. Armand St Just is a man in the Road. Louise is married to Armand. Monsieur St Just is a man. He engenders Armand and Marguerite.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;out / west / east / west&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Monsieur St Just never appears on the scene in this piece, but if we did put him somewhere the player could find him, he, too, would be properly introduced.
