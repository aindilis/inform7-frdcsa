<p>Inform's &quot;door&quot; kind provides for a tangible thing which comes between one room and another. A door can be open or closed, and openable or not: it can be locked or unlocked, and lockable or not. Here we create a conventional door, a natural gap in the rocks, and a (fixed in place) wooden ladder:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The fire door is an open door. The fire door is east of the Projection Booth and west of the Fire Escape.
<br>The narrow crevice is an open unopenable door. The crevice is east of the Col du Prafleuri and west of Rocky Knoll Above Arolla.
<br>The wooden ladder is an open unopenable door. The ladder is above the Stableyard and below the Hay Loft.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Most doors are visible from both sides: they are single objects but present in two rooms at once, which raises a number of complications. Inform normally uses the same description looking from each way, which is not very interesting: <b>When?</b> and <b>Whence?</b> demonstrate neat ways to describe the two sides differently, and <b>Whither?</b> adds the option for the player to refer to doors as &quot;the west door&quot; and &quot;the east door&quot; automatically.
<p>
<p><b>Neighbourhood Watch</b> goes further by making a door behave differently on each side: from the &quot;outside&quot; you need a key, but &quot;inside&quot; it opens on a latch. Finally, <b>Garibaldi 1</b> shows how to access information about the two sides of a door.
<p>
<p><b>Higher Calling</b> demonstrates doors which automatically open as needed: though using the Inform extension Locksmith by Emily Short is probably easier and better. <b>Elsie</b>, conversely, demonstrates a door that closes one turn after the player has opened it.
<p>
<p>Certain complications apply when characters other than the player have to see and interact with doors that exist in other rooms. <b>Wainwright Acts</b> demonstrates the syntax needed to handle this technically quirky situation.
<p>
<p><b>Something Narsty</b> and <b>Hayseed</b> provide a &quot;staircase&quot; kind useful for vertically arranged, always-open doors like staircases and (fixed in place) ladders.
<p>
<p><b>One Short Plank</b> implements a precarious plank bridge across a chasm as an open unopenable door.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;climb ladder / g&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Attempts to climb other types of door will still be treated as useless.
