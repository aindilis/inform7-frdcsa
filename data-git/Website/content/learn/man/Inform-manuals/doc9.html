<p>
<p>The Skein records the history of different plays through the current project, and the Transcript records the text of each response, comparing it with a &quot;blessed&quot; or correct version if one is available.
<p>
<p>In the Skein each typed command is a &quot;knot&quot;. The threads hanging down from the top &quot;- start -&quot; knot are possible histories. Double-click on a knot to play through to there.
<p>
<p>Yellow knots are commands played so far in the current game: green knots are possible lines not taken, or not taken yet.
<p>
<p>A solid thread is &quot;locked&quot; and protected from deletion (by accident or when Inform trims away loose ends): a dashed thread has no such protection.
<p>
<p>A bright knot has a blessed transcript: a darker knot is one which has no blessed transcript. When a bright knot shows a red badge, this means that when last tested its command produced a textual reply which wasn't the same as the blessed transcript. Clicking on the badge shows exactly how.
<p>
<p>The thicker thread in the Skein shows the history currently being displayed in the Transcript panel.
