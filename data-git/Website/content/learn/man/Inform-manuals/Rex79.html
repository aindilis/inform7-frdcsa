<p>The kind &quot;container&quot; allows one thing to contain others. Things are sometimes containers automatically, sometimes by instruction:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The match is in the matchbox. The bucket is a container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The matchbox, like the bucket, is a container. Containers come in all sizes and have a variety of behaviours, mainly controlled by the properties we give them: they can be &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot;, &quot;opaque&quot; or &quot;transparent&quot; (when closed), &quot;openable&quot; or not, &quot;lockable&quot; or not, &quot;enterable&quot; or not. The basic ideas of containment are to do with carrying and sometimes hiding the contents, and Inform makes this easy. Allowing for locking and unlocking is again straightforward:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The strongbox is a locked container. The little steel key unlocks the strongbox.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For a container with a combination lock, rather than a key, see <b>Safety</b>; for a more sophisticated safe requiring digits dialed over multiple turns, see <b>Eyes, Fingers, Toes</b>.
<p>
<p><b>Trachypachidae Maturin 1803</b> provides a bottle that is stoppered with a cork: when it is closed, the cork is part of the bottle, but otherwise the cork becomes a separate object we can carry around.
<p>
<p>The normal assumption is that there is no problem with any two portable items being carried together, but in reality they may affect each other. (For effects like magnetism, or getting each other wet, or setting each other on fire, see the Physics chapter.) Here is a cat which, if boxed up with one or more items of food, will eat something each turn until all is gone:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a wicker basket and a scarlet fish. The cat is an animal in the wicker basket. The fish is edible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when the cat is in a container (called the bag) and something edible (called the foodstuff) is in the bag:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the foodstuff from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;With mingled sounds of mewing and chomping, the cat nibbles up [the foodstuff].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The examples below provide subtler effects, adapting text to the current situation. In <b>Cinco</b>, the container's name changes depending on what it contains: putting beef in a taco allows the player to call it a SHREDDED BEEF TACO. In <b>Unpeeled</b> and <b>Shipping Trunk</b>, the description of something inside a container changes according to other things are alongside it. This is taken further in <b>Hudsucker Industries</b>, which describes the contents of a container as a group.
<p>
<p>Finally, any action that destroys a container has to consider what to do with the things inside. <b>Fallout Enclosure</b> demonstrates a zapping action that destroys cash registers and shelves but leaves their contents tidily behind.

<p>
<p>It's fairly common that we want to be able to refer to a container in terms of what it has in it: a bottle of wine, a salt shaker, a chicken sandwich. The player is free to remove the contents again, and the object will go back to using its usual name:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Cinco&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Cinco de Mayo Fundraiser is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The taco shell is an edible thing in the Fundraiser. It is a portable container. It has carrying capacity 1.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;[something related by containment] taco&quot; as the taco.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of the taco shell while not inserting or removing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the taco contains something (called filling), say &quot;[filling] taco&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;taco shell&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;omit contents in listing.

<p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
