<p>
<p>&quot;Asking ... to try ...&quot; actions run through their Before and Instead rules like any other actions, but then (if no rule has intervened) something different happens: Inform has to decide whether the person asked consents to try the action or not. By default, the answer is always no, and text like the following will be printed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">> will, go west
<br>Will has better things to do.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>However, we can intervene to make the answer &quot;yes&quot;, using a special kind of rule which produces a yes/no answer. The following examples show how we can give broad or narrow permission, as we choose:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Persuasion rule for asking people to try going: persuasion succeeds.
<br>Persuasion rule for asking Will to try going west: persuasion succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Such a rule can either declare that &quot;persuasion succeeds&quot;, or that &quot;persuasion fails&quot;, or make no decision and leave it to another rule to say. If it decides that persuasion fails, it is also allowed to say something, describing why: in that event, the standard message (&quot;Will has better things to do.&quot;) is suppressed. For example,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Persuasion rule for asking Will to try going:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Will looks put out, and mutters under his breath.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persuasion fails.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The following rule, which is really only suitable for testing, makes everybody infinitely obliging:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Persuasion rule for asking people to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Supposing that Will does decide to cooperate, a new action is generated:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Will going west
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and this is then subject to all of the usual action machinery. For instance, we could write a rule such as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of Will going west, say &quot;He runs out into the waves, but soon returns, rueful.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So in this case the new action (&quot;Will going west&quot;) failed: but the original action, &quot;asking Will to try going west&quot;, is still deemed to have succeeded - after all, Will <i>did</i> try. To put it more formally, &quot;asking X to try A&quot; succeeds if the persuasion rules succeed, and otherwise fails.
<p>
<p>Note also that &quot;Instead of...&quot; rules written for other people will be treated by Inform as failures, even if we write something like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of Will pulling the cord:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The bell rings.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and thus may produce unsatisfactory results such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>WILL, PULL CORD
<br>The bell rings.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Will is unable to do that.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we wish to write new successful actions for another character, we will need to create appropriate carry out and report rules for them: these will be explained in the sections to follow.
<p>
<p>(Finally, note that the mechanism Inform uses to see if we have printed a refusal message of our own, in the event of persuasion rules failing, can be fooled if we write a persuasion rule explicitly ending with a &quot;[paragraph break]&quot; text substitution.)

<p>

<p>We will learn more about check rules for other characters shortly, but the following prevents the hypnosis patient from trying to hypnotize us in turn:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check someone hypnotizing someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Maison de la Magie is a room. &quot;In a darkened room, a few hundreds of paces from the chateau of Blois, you give to tourists three shows a day: displaying to them power they do not comprehend and spectacles they do not deserve.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A volunteer is a woman in the Maison. &quot;A volunteer from the audience stands facing you, [if alert]skeptically awaiting hypnosis[otherwise]her face worshipful and obedient[end if].&quot; The printed name of the volunteer is &quot;volunteer from the audience&quot;. The description is &quot;A distracted, susceptible woman.&quot; The volunteer wears a t-shirt and a baseball hat.
