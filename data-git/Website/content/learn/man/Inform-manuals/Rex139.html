Character Emotion</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>In a complex story, characters may evolve strong feelings about the player. Often we want to hint at the character's feelings through gesture and tone of voice - little things woven into dialogue and action sequences that might otherwise be unchanged. <b>Ferragamo Again</b> demonstrates creating phrases to give all our characters different ways to express their irritation at the player.
<p>
<p>Then again, sometimes a discussion might produce quite spectacular results if a character is in the wrong mood. <b>Being Peter</b> shows the bare bones of an implementation in which a character's attitude rulebook is consulted to determine what her response will be - allowing for arbitrarily complicated outcomes.

<p>Here we use phrases that match individual items where possible, and the general kind otherwise:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Ferragamo Again&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Break Room is a room. Vanessa, Tina, and Lisa are women in the Break Room. Mark and Holman are men in the Break Room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the commands &quot;ask&quot; and &quot;tell&quot; and &quot;answer&quot; as something new.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;talk about [any subject]&quot; as talking about. Talking about is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;talk about [text]&quot; as talking randomly about. Talking randomly about is an action applying to one topic. Carry out talking randomly about: say &quot;Mostly you're interested in [the list of subjects].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out talking about something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the previous subject is the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report talking about something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You chat for a while about [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A subject is a kind of thing. Assyrian vowel sounds, designer handbags, and instant run-off voting are subjects. Understand &quot;linguistics&quot; and &quot;mute&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; as sounds. Understand &quot;prada&quot; and &quot;tods&quot; and &quot;coach&quot; and &quot;carmen marc valvo&quot; as designer handbags. Understand &quot;reform&quot; and &quot;election&quot; and &quot;election fraud&quot; and &quot;two-party system&quot; and &quot;Diebold&quot; as instant run-off voting.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say (annoyed-person - a person) gestures in irritation:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The annoyed-person] sighs heavily. [run paragraph on]&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say (annoyed-person - Vanessa) gestures in irritation:

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The previous subject is a subject that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of talking about something for more than one turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is the previous subject, say &quot;[a random visible person who is not the player gestures in irritation]Maybe you should let this one go.[line break][paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise continue the action.
