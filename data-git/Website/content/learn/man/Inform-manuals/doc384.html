<p>This chapter and the next are about what to do when we have a complete, finished work on our hands.
<p>
<p>For almost all of the time when a new work of IF is being written, it lives inside the familiar two-panel spread of the Inform user interface. But that isn't how eventual players will experience it. They will want to play a &quot;story file&quot; in a standard format, and they will do so with a wide range of different interpreters on many different computers or websites, including some -- like mobile phones -- on which Inform itself will not run.
<p>
<p>So how does a new work of IF reach players? The simple answer, covered in this chapter, is that clicking the Release button instead of Go causes Inform to output a stand-alone story file. But as we will see, Release can do much more than that: it can attach covers, include bibliographic data, make websites and much more. Releasing is the process of making all of the material we want to deliver to our eventual players.
<p>
<p>But that is only the first step. What do we do with the material when we have it? Printing out a manuscript of a novel is not the same as publishing it. So the next chapter, on Publishing, completes the story.
