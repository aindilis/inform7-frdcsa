Dice and Playing Cards</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Most toys are single things, and no harder to create than any other small items, but games often require a multitude of tokens to be combined, and this can be logistically tricky.
<p>
<p>The classic example is a pack of playing cards, where the player must individually control 52 items but without fussy commands or verbose text being printed back. <b>Jokers Wild</b> provides a simple &quot;one card at a time&quot; approach; <b>Tilt 1</b> is more sophisticated, with 52 independently accessible cards; <b>Tilt 2</b> can further judge the value of a selection of cards - the ranking of a poker hand.
<p>
<p>Drawing cards from a shuffled pack is only one source of randomness. Games of chance also involve items drawn from a bag: <b>Wonka's Revenge</b> provides just such a lottery. More often, dice are thrown. A single die is easy enough:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The die is carried by the player. After dropping the die: say &quot;It lands with [a random number from 1 to 6] uppermost.&quot; Understand &quot;roll [something]&quot; as dropping.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Quick, but not very good. Most dice games involve rolling more than one die at a time, to get a more interesting distribution of outcomes: they may also involve special rules applying to doubles, for instance. See <b>Do Pass Go</b>.

The drum is closed and openable.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;spin [something]&quot; as spinning.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Spinning is an action with past participle spun, applying to one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check spinning: if the noun is an open container which contains something, say &quot;[The list of things in the noun] would fly out.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out spinning a container:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shuffle the contents of the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report spinning:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun contains something, say &quot;You rattle [if the noun is transparent][the list of things in the noun][otherwise]the stuff[end if] in [the noun].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;Nothing results of your shaking [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform keeps track of the order in which things have been put into a container. If we want to change that order without the player's intervention, we can move the things ourselves.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To shuffle the contents of (basket - a container):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let moves be the number of things in the basket;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with counter running from 1 to moves:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move a random thing in the basket to the basket.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After opening the drum when we have spun the drum for the first time:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if something (called the pick) is in the drum:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try searching the drum;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The pick] it is, then.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try taking the pick;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the pick is the ticket of pure gold, end the story finally;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise end the story saying &quot;Oh well, better luck next time.&quot;
