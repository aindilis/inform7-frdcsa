Standard tokens of grammar</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>We have already seen &quot;[something]&quot; and &quot;[someone]&quot;, which are standard examples of &quot;tokens of grammar&quot; - patterns matched by suitable named things. There are several other standard tokens, provided not so much from necessity but to allow the game parser to be more graceful and responsive. &quot;[someone]&quot; matches the same possibilities as &quot;[a person]&quot; would, but the parser handles it a little better in cases of failure. These special tokens are best explained by looking at some of the examples in the standard grammar, which can be browsed in the Index of any game.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;wear [something preferably held]&quot; as wearing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here we expect that the named item will be one that is held by the player, and the parser will use this to resolve ambiguities between names of things carried and not carried. (If the action is one which positively requires that its noun be something carried, such as &quot;eating&quot;, then a command matching this token against something not carried will generate an automatic attempt to take it.)
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;take [things]&quot; as taking.
<br>Understand &quot;drop [things preferably held]&quot; as dropping.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;[things]&quot; is like &quot;[something]&quot; but allows a list of items, or a vague plural like &quot;all&quot;, to be typed. The result will be a sequence of actions, one for each item thus described. &quot;[things preferably held]&quot; is the analogous token for &quot;[something preferably held]&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;take [things inside] from [something]&quot; as removing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;[things inside]&quot; matches only what is inside the second-named thing, and ensures that (for instance) the command &quot;take all from box&quot; does not also try to take the box.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;put [other things] in/inside/into [something]&quot; as inserting it into.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Similarly, &quot;[other things]&quot; will allow anything except the second-named thing. (Like &quot;[things inside]&quot; it is really only needed for handling containers.)

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e219"><a href=doc263.html#e219 STYLE="text-decoration: none">***<b><b>Example</b> 284:  The Left Hand of Autumn</b></a><br>The possibility of using a [things] token opens up some interesting complications, because we may want actions on multiple items to be reported differently from actions on just one. Here we look at how to make a multiple examination command that describes groups in special ways.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose that we have a game in which groups of objects can have meaning apart from their individual significance -- perhaps there are spells that can only be cast by collecting just the right items in the same place.
<p>
<p>In this case, one of the things the player might like to be able to do is look at several items together and get a special response, different from looking at the items individually.
<p>
<p>To make this happen, we need to do several things:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">(1) we need to create a version of the EXAMINE command that can apply to multiple objects at once.
<br>(2) we need to correct the way Inform normally deals with multiple-object commands, because we want our group description to print only one time, and we want to avoid stubs such as &quot;pear: ... apple: ...&quot; before or after the group description.
<br>(3) we need to define a way for Inform to identify interesting groups and describe them.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;The Left Hand of Autumn&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 1 - Procedure
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;examine [things]&quot; or &quot;look at [things]&quot; as multiply-examining. Multiply-examining is an action applying to one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;examine [things inside] in/on [something]&quot; or &quot;look at [things inside] in/on [something]&quot; as multiply-examining it from. Multiply-examining it from is an action applying to two things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Group-description-complete is a truth state that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out multiply-examining it from:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try multiply-examining the noun instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check multiply-examining when group-description-complete is true:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out multiply-examining:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let L be the list of matched things;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of entries in L is 0, try examining the noun instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of entries in L is 1, try examining entry 1 of L instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;describe L;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say line break;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now group-description-complete is true.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now group-description-complete is false.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now for step 2, overriding Inform's usual output of names of objects:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The silently announce items from multiple object lists rule is listed instead of the announce items from multiple object lists rule in the action-processing rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the silently announce items from multiple object lists rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless multiply-examining or multiply-examining something from something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the current item from the multiple object list is not nothing, say &quot;[current item from the multiple object list]: [run paragraph on]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is matched if it is listed in the multiple object list.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We'll save our &quot;to describe&quot; phrase until Section 2, when we can give the game specific instructions about how to report different lists of objects.
<p>
<p>Now, the player might also want to be able to refer to a group of item by some kind of group name, so let's add the option of creating a Table of Collective Names which will interpret these:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat through the Table of Collective Names:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let N be indexed text;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let N be the player's command;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Y be indexed text;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Y be relevant list entry;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while N matches the regular expression &quot;[name-text entry]&quot;:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replace the regular expression &quot;(.*)[name-text entry](.*)&quot; in N with &quot;\1[Y]\2&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the text of the player's command to N.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report taking something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You pick up [the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And as a bit of polish, because we'd like SEARCH TABLE to have the same effect as EXAMINE ALL ON TABLE:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;look on [something]&quot; as searching.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of searching something which supports at least two things:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let L be the list of things supported by the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;describe L.
<br>Instead of searching something which contains at least two things:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let L be the list of things contained by the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;describe L.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 2 - Scenario
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Eight-Walled Chamber is a room. &quot;A perfectly octagonal room whose walls are tinted in various hues.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The display table is a supporter in the Chamber. A twig of rowan wood is on the table.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries an apple and a pear.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A glove is a kind of thing. A glove is always wearable. Understand &quot;glove&quot; as a glove. The player carries a left glove and a right glove. The left glove and the right glove are gloves.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we define a few actual lists of items:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Fruit list is a list of objects which varies. Fruit list is { apple, pear }.
<br>Glove list is a list of objects which varies. Glove list is { right glove, left glove }.
<br>Arcane list is a list of objects which varies. Arcane list is { left glove, twig, pear }.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To describe (L - a list of objects):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sort L;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if L is fruit list:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Just a couple of fruits.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise if L is glove list:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;It's a matched pair of fuzzy blue gloves.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise if L is arcane list:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;To anyone else it might look like a random collection of objects, but these three things -- [L with definite articles] -- constitute a mystic key known as the Left Hand of Autumn. They practically hum with power.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You see [L with indefinite articles].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sort fruit list;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sort glove list;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sort the arcane list.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We sort the lists so that regardless of how we change the rest of the code (and the order in which objects are coded), the resulting list will always be in sorted order and ready to compare with the list of items the player wants to look at. And thanks to the &quot;Reading a command&quot; code we wrote earlier, we can also teach the game to understand the player's references to &quot;the left hand of autumn&quot; as a specific collection of items.
