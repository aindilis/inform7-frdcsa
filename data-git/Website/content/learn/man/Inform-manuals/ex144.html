<p>Chapter 2 noted that surveys of Inform source text showed that the three most popular phrases used by authors are &quot;say&quot;, &quot;if&quot; and &quot;now&quot;. The fourth most popular is &quot;try&quot;, which allows us to trigger off actions ourselves, rather than waiting for the player to type something which generates them. Thus:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>try </b>(action)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_try -->

<p>This phrase makes the action, which has to be named literally, take effect now. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of entering the trapdoor, try going up.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>It's as if the player had typed GO UP as a command. Note that the action has to be specific:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">try eating something;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>is not allowed, since it doesn't say exactly what is to be eaten.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>The word &quot;try&quot; is intended to make clear that there is no guarantee of success. For example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before locking the front door, try closing the front door.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>could go wrong in any number of ways - perhaps the door is closed already, perhaps it is not openable, perhaps somebody has wedged it open. It would be safer to write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before locking the front door:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try closing the front door;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the front door is open, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There's no need to say anything if closing didn't work, because the closing action will have done that already. A neater approach still is to use:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>silently try </b>(stored action)<b></b><br><i>or:</i> <b>try silently </b>(stored action)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_trysilently -->

<p>This phrase makes the action, which has to be named literally, take effect now, under the &quot;silent&quot; convention which means that routine messages aren't printed. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">try silently taking the napkin;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Silence is maintained only if this new action, the taking of the napkin, is successful (so if the napkin is successfully taken, the text &quot;Taken.&quot; will not appear): if the action should fail, a suitable objection will be voiced as usual.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>So now we have:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before locking the front door:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try silently closing the front door;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the front door is open, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And this is neater because it won't produce a pointless &quot;You close the front door.&quot; message.

<a name="e144"><a href=doc106.html#e144 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 88:  Fine Laid</b></a><br>Making writing that can be separately examined from the paper on which it appears, but which directs all other actions to the paper.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to direct all -- or almost all -- actions from one object to another. For the sake of argument, say we have a sheet of paper with writing on it, and (because we're very meticulous) we want to let the player examine the writing and get a customized response, different from when he just examines the sheet of paper. But for all other purposes -- say, TAKE or TASTE -- we want the two objects to be treated as one.
<p>
<p>Here, we approach the problem by changing the noun and/or the second noun of the current action, then issuing a new command to &quot;try the current action&quot;. Because we've changed the noun and second noun, the &quot;current action&quot; at this point is different from the one generated originally by the player's command.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;Fine Laid&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">High Street Stationer is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The sheet of paper is a thing in High Street Stationer. The writing is part of the sheet of paper.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the sheet of paper is &quot;A beautiful sheet of heavy cream paper.&quot; The description of the writing is &quot;Delicate and spidery.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of tasting the sheet of paper, say &quot;You might need more fiber in your diet, but this isn't the way.&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before doing something other than examining when the current action involves the writing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the writing is the noun, now the noun is the sheet of paper;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the writing is the second noun, now the second noun is the sheet of paper;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try the current action instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;examine sheet of paper / examine writing / get writing / taste writing&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
