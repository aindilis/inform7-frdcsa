<p>If our work is more a work of digital literature than a game, different venues are appropriate. PlayThisThing may still be interested; JayIsGames probably will not be. Instead, we might want to look at
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><b>GrandTextAuto</b> (www.grandtextauto.com): a group blog about new media and interactive story-telling, which sometimes posts announcements of interactive fiction, especially of the more literary kind.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><b>The Electronic Literature Organization</b> (http://eliterature.org/): an organization dedicated to preserving all kinds of new media literature. They list a number of events (such as readings open to the public, new media gallery exhibits, etc.) that an IF author could participate in, and they also have a directory of electronic literature, to which we can add our own works.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><b>Digital Humanities Quarterly</b> (http://www.noraproject.org/dhq/index.shtml): A scholarly publication, but one that looks at all aspects of digital literature, new media tie-ins for scholarship, etc. DHQ has run several articles about interactive fiction in the past, including Dennis Jerz's ground-breaking research on the writing of the first text adventure, Colossal Cave. DHQ might be open either to hosting a work or to publishing an article about it.

<p>That still leaves out a category of IF -- namely, work written for a popular reading audience, work that isn't trying to be literary but also isn't primarily game-like. There are, at the moment, no ideal venues for promoting such work (that we're aware of), but it's certainly worth pursuing.
