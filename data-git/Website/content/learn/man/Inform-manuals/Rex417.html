<p>It is too easily assumed that room descriptions are what the player sees, but as <b>The Undertomb</b> demonstrates, they might just as easily include ambient sounds.
<p>
<p>So Inform's &quot;listening to&quot; action is the audio equivalent of &quot;examining&quot;, rather than &quot;looking&quot;. Despite this the player can type LISTEN, which Inform understands as listening to the everything in the location at once. A simple but effective way to handle this is shown in <b>The Art of Noise</b>.
<p>
<p><b>Four Stars 2</b> adjusts the idea of &quot;visibility&quot; to make it behave differently for listening purposes: this introduces a formal idea of &quot;audibility&quot;.

<a name="e417"><a href=Rdoc15.html#e417 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 350: Scope for listening different from scope for seeing</b></a><br>Using "deciding the scope" to change the content of lists such as "the list of audible things which can be touched by the player".<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>As we have seen, a well-written understand rule will often solve the problem of allowing the player to apply specific actions to objects not normally in scope. When we need to adjust scope for some other reason than reading the player's command, though, &quot;deciding the scope of...&quot; may come in handy.
<p>
<p>For instance, adding this to our Waning Moon example
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Balcony is outside from the Resort. In the Balcony is a tomcat. The sound of the tomcat is &quot;yowling&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while listening:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if in darkness:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with locale running through adjacent rooms:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place locale in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A procedural rule while listening:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignore the can't reach inside rooms rule.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>would put audible objects in adjacent rooms in scope even when the player does not specifically listen to them. So the player would receive the following message when listening:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>listen
<br>You hear the soothing whalesong from the Bose speaker and the yowling from the tomcat.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is because the rule that defines what we can hear inside the room, namely
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of listening to a room:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if an audible thing can be touched by the player, say &quot;You hear [the list of audible things which can be touched by the player].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;A merciful peace prevails.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>now includes the tomcat in the &quot;list of audible things which can be touched by the player&quot;. Touchability has been modified by our scope adjustment, but only during the listening action. Otherwise the tomcat remains in the other room and off-limits.
