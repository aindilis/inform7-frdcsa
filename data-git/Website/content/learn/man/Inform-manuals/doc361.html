<p>
<p>In the chapter on Descriptions, we saw that a description can be any source text which describes one or more objects: it might be as simple as &quot;the Corn Market&quot;, or as complicated as &quot;open containers which are in dark rooms&quot;. More or less the only restriction is that it must be unambiguous as to what counts and what does not: &quot;three containers&quot; is ambiguous as a description because it does not say which three.
<p>
<p>We've now seen several interesting tricks with descriptions. In fact, if D is a description, then
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;You gaze mournfully at [the list of D].&quot;;
<br>let the tally be the number of D;
<br>let the surprise prize be a random D;
<br>repeat with item running through D:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>are all standard things to do. These examples make it look as if it must be possible to define phrases which act on descriptions, and in fact it is, because a description can be a value in itself. For example,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">even numbers
<br>open containers which are in dark rooms
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>are values of kind &quot;description of numbers&quot; and &quot;description of objects&quot; respectively. In general, if K is any kind then &quot;description of K&quot; is also a kind. Here is how we might make use of that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To enumerate (collection - a description of objects):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with the item running through the collection:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;-- [The item].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This makes &quot;enumerate lighted rooms&quot; run off a list of lighted rooms in a textual format different from the standard one produced by &quot;say the list of lighted rooms&quot;. Inside the definition, &quot;collection&quot; can be used wherever a description might be used: here, for instance, we use it as the range for the repeat loop. (That's only possible because the range is limited in size: Inform wouldn't have allowed us to range through, say, all texts.)
<p>
<p>Purely as a convenience, we can also write &quot;member of&quot; or &quot;members of&quot; in this context. For instance, in the enumerate definition, it would have been just as good to write &quot;...running through the members of the collection...&quot; in the repeat. (Similarly, we could write &quot;number of members of the collection&quot; or &quot;a random member of the collection&quot;, which looks grammatically tidier than writing &quot;number of the collection&quot; or &quot;random of the collection&quot; - though in fact both of these do work.)
<p>
<p>Finally, it's sometimes useful in an abstract situation to test
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><i>if</i> <b></b>(value)<b> matches </b>(description of values)<b></b><i>:</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_valuematch -->

<p>This condition is true if the value matches the description; the kinds must be compatible, or Inform will issue a problem message. There is no point using this for cases where the description is given explicitly:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if 4 matches even numbers, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because it is easier to write just:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if 4 is an even number, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So this condition is only useful when the description is stored in some variable, and its identity is not known.
