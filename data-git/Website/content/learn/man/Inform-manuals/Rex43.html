Scoring</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Not every work of IF allots a numerical score to the player: for some authors, this emphasises the idea of a game rather than a narrative. The simple sentence
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use no scoring.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>abolishes the concept. Otherwise, Inform will provide built-in support for a single number measuring progress (&quot;score&quot;), and will expect to measure this against a maximum possible (&quot;maximum score&quot;, which can either be set by hand or worked out automatically from a table of ranks).
<p>
<p>In a game in which scoring exists, the player may choose to turn score notifications (such as &quot;[Your score has just gone up by one point.]&quot;) on or off. The commands to do this are NOTIFY ON and NOTIFY OFF; the actions are called switching score notification on and switching score notification off. In the event that we need to amend the behavior of notification, we could do so by adding, removing, or modifying the elements of the check and carry out rulebooks for these commands; as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check switching score notification off:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the turn count is less than 10:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You are still a novice, grasshopper. Allow your teacher to give you advice until such time as you are ready to go on alone.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we wish to change the wording of the default message (&quot;[Your score has...&quot;), we may want to resort to extensions available from the Inform website which allow access to all the default messages in a game.
<p>
<p>An especially insidious style of bug allows the player to type the same sequence of commands over and over, earning score endlessly for the same insight, and to avoid this it is usually safest to write source like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After taking the Picasso miniature when the Picasso miniature is not handled:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;award 10 points; say &quot;As they say in Montmartre: dude!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We might also write our condition with &quot;for the first time&quot;, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After jumping for the first time:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;award 5 points;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Boing! That was certainly entertaining.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But we should be careful not to use &quot;for the first time&quot; in scoring situations where it's possible for the player to try the action but fail. Inform counts even unsuccessful attempts towards the number of times an action is understood to have occurred, so if the player tries to jump and fails, his &quot;for the first time&quot; will be used up and he will never receive the score points.
<p>
<p>If there are many &quot;treasure&quot; items like the Picasso miniature, it is best to be systematic, as in <b>No Place Like Home</b>. <b>Bosch</b> takes another approach to the same idea, by creating a table of point-earning actions that the player will be rewarded for doing; the FULL SCORE command will then play these back.
<p>
<p><b>Mutt's Adventure</b> demonstrates how we might add a scored room feature, such that the player earns a point when he first arrives at a special room.
<p>
<p>A single number does not really sum up a life, or even an afternoon, and <b>Goat-Cheese and Sage Chicken</b> and <b>Panache</b> offer more detailed citations. Works that are more story than game may prefer to offer a plot summary of the player's experience to date in lieu of more conventional scoring.
<p>
<p>Finally, <b>Rubies</b> provides a scoreboard that keeps track of the ten highest-scoring players from one playthrough to the next.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>We could, if we wanted, make a table of stored actions all of which represent things that will earn points for the player. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Bosch&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Garden of Excess is a room. The gilded lily is an edible thing in the Garden of Excess.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Pathway to Desire is west of the Garden of Excess. The emerald leaf is in the Pathway.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Table of Valuable Actions
<br><table border="0" valign="top" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">relevant action</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">point value</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><font color="#000080">turn stamp</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

</tr></table>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(And our list would presumably continue from there, in the full game.)
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The maximum score is 25.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After doing something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat through Table of Valuable Actions:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the current action is the relevant action entry and turn stamp entry is less than 0:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the turn stamp entry is the turn count;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase the score by the point value entry;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;full score&quot; or &quot;full&quot; as requesting the complete score. Requesting the complete score is an action out of world.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check requesting the complete score:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the score is 0, say &quot;You have not yet achieved anything of note.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out requesting the complete score:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;So far you have received points for the following: [line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sort the Table of Valuable Actions in turn stamp order;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat through the Table of Valuable Actions:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the turn stamp entry is greater than 0:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[line break]  [relevant action entry]: [point value entry] points&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say line break.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;eat lily / w / full score / get leaf / full&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This system is tidy, but limited: we cannot give actions interesting names in the score list, like &quot;seducing the pirate's daughter&quot; or &quot;collecting a valuable artifact&quot;. So it will not be ideal in all situations, but it has the virtue of being easy to extend, and of listing all of the player's successes in the order in which they occurred in his play-through.
