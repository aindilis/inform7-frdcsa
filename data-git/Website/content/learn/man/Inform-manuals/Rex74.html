<p>&quot;Disenchantment Bay&quot; is a simple work of IF used as a running example in Chapter 3 of <i>Writing with Inform</i> - not so much a tutorial as a convenient hook on which to hang some demonstrations of the basics. Because the resulting examples only use basic features and in the most straightforward way, they make for uninteresting &quot;recipes&quot; - so they are not included in the <i>Recipe Book</i> proper. But some readers might like to have all twelve stages of the example gathered on a single page: this is that page.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the windows is &quot;They're a bit the worse for wear, but you can still get an impressive view of the glacier through them. There were whales earlier, but they're gone now.&quot; Understand &quot;window&quot; as the windows.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A beverage is a kind of thing. A beverage can be openable or unopenable. A beverage is always edible and openable. A beverage has a heat. A beverage is usually warm. The Coke is a beverage. The beer is a beverage. The beer is in the backpack.
