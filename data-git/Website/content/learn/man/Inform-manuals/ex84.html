<p>
<p>The &quot;photographing&quot; action now works very nicely when the player does it. But not when others try. Suppose that neither the player, nor Clark Gable, is holding the camera:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>photograph clark
<br>You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>clark, photograph me
<br>>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>An uncanny silence. What has happened is that the rules written so far are all implicitly restricted to the player only. This is because when we write -
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check photographing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the camera is not carried:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>the action is &quot;photographing&quot;, not &quot;Clark photographing&quot;. In the next few sections we shall see how to make the rules work nicely for everybody. This is a little bit harder, so it should be noted right away that in many projects there is no need. In a game which has no other characters who succumb to persuasion, for instance, only the player will ever try the action.

<a name="e84"><a href=doc197.html#e84 STYLE="text-decoration: none">**<b><b>Example</b> 203:  The Man of Steel</b></a><br>An escaping action which means "go to any room you can reach from here", and is only useful to non-player characters.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>It will sometimes be handy to write actions that are only available to the non-player characters and not to the player. To do this, we just define an action which has no &quot;understand&quot;: the player will never be able to specify this command himself, but other characters can try it.
<p>
<p>This is particularly useful for creating abstract or general actions for when we want a character to eat something, wear something, or go somewhere, but aren't too particular as to what the object is; as here, where we just want Clark to move away from the kryptonite, regardless of direction:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;The Man of Steel&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Escaping is an action applying to nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out someone escaping:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let space be the holder of the person asked;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let place be a random room which is adjacent to the space;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let way be the best route from the space to the place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try the person asked going way.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Clark Kent can see kryptonite, try Clark Kent escaping.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Daily Planet Newsroom is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Perry White's Office is west of the Newsroom. In Perry White's Office are a desk and a poster of Elvis. On the desk is a lead-lined box. The box is openable. In the box is the green kryptonite crystal.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Supply Closet is east of the Newsroom. The Elevator Bank is north of the Newsroom.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Clark Kent is a man in the Newsroom. &quot;Clark [if Clark can see the kryptonite]looks a bit ill[otherwise]is here, frowning as he revises his latest article[end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;west / get box / east / close box / east / west / north / south / west&quot;.
