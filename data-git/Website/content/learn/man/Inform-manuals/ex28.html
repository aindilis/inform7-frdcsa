<p>&quot;Now&quot; has already appeared several times in this chapter, being used like a Swiss army knife to change values of all kinds:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now the score is 100;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In fact, &quot;now&quot; is by far the most flexible phrase known to Inform.
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>now </b>(a condition)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_now -->

<p>This phrase makes the condition become true. Examples:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now the score is 100;
<br>now the player is Kevin;
<br>now the front door is open;
<br>now Mr Darcy is wearing the top hat;
<br>now all the doors are open;
<br>now all of the things in the sack are in the box;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform issues a problem message if the condition asks to do the impossible (&quot;now 3 is an even number&quot;) or is vague (&quot;now the duck is not in the Lily Pond&quot;) or not in the present tense (&quot;now the front door had been open&quot;).

<p>We've now seen all three things which can be done with a condition S which describes the world:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">S. - The relation holds at the start of play.
<br>if S, ...; - Does the relation hold right now?
<br>now S; - Make the relation hold from now on.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The apple is in the basket.
<br>if the apple is in the basket, ...;
<br>now the apple is in the basket;
</font></blockquote><p>

<a name="e28"><a href=doc132.html#e28 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 125:  Bee Chambers</b></a><br>A maze with directions between rooms randomized at the start of play.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Mazes are a traditional element of interactive fiction, often consisting of apparently identical rooms with exits that do not work reciprocally and which cause confusion.
<p>
<p>The methods of mapping mazes are now fairly well understood and mazes themselves tend to be regarded as tiresome rather than enjoyable by a large portion of the playing audience. However, if we did want to ignore the common wisdom and create a maze, randomly generated at the start of play, here would be one way to go about it:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Maze of Gloom&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A Bee Chamber is a kind of room. The printed name of a Bee Chamber is usually &quot;Hexagonal Room&quot;. The description of a Bee Chamber is usually &quot;Waxy, translucent walls surround you on six sides; the floor and ceiling are made of the same material, gently uneven. There are exits in every direction, cut into the faces or the corners.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Bee1, Bee2, Bee3, Bee4, Bee5, Bee6, Bee7, Bee8, Bee9, and Bee10 are Bee Chambers.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now right hand status line is &quot;[number of visited rooms]/[number of rooms]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with place running through Bee Chambers:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now a random Bee Chamber is mapped north of place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now a random Bee Chamber is mapped northwest of place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now a random Bee Chamber is mapped west of place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now a random Bee Chamber is mapped southwest of place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now a random Bee Chamber is mapped south of place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now a random Bee Chamber is mapped southeast of place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now a random Bee Chamber is mapped east of place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now a random Bee Chamber is mapped northeast of place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now a random Bee Chamber is mapped above place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now a random Bee Chamber is mapped below place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now a random Bee Chamber is mapped inside place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now a random Bee Chamber is mapped outside place.
