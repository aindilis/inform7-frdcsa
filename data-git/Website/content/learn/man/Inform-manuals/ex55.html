<p>
<p>It seems unwise for a door in Notting Hill to be unlocked, so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The blue door is lockable and locked. The matching key of the blue door is the brass Yale key.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Since the second sentence here is a little clumsy, we can equivalently say
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The brass Yale key unlocks the blue door.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Yet a third way to say this is:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The blue door has matching key the brass Yale key.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This introduces three new properties: a door can be locked or unlocked; lockable or not lockable; and it can have a matching key, which must be another thing. The same thing can be the matching key of many different locks: and note that a door can be locked and even lockable without having a matching key at all, in which case the player trying to open it will be permanently out of luck. Doors are ordinarily unlocked, not lockable, and without a matching key.
<p>
<p>Containers can also have locks, in exactly the same way, and are allowed to have the same properties. On the other hand supporters never have locks: it makes no sense to be able to lock a tabletop, for instance, and Inform will not allow any discussion of the matching key of a supporter, or of a supporter being locked or unlocked.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e55"><a href=doc40.html#e55 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 22: Disenchantment Bay 6</b></a><br>Disenchantment Bay: locking up the charter boat's fishing rods.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>It stands to reason that the captain wouldn't let just anyone meddle with his fishing equipment; maybe he keeps that case locked. We could replace the case description with this one, instead:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Cabin contains a glass case. In the glass case is a collection of fishing rods. The case is closed, transparent, openable, lockable, and locked. The case is scenery. The small silver key unlocks the case.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now there's a silver key that will unlock it -- though since we haven't said where the key is, the player will never be able to find it in the game. (If we look at the World index, we find &quot;small silver key&quot; right at the bottom, not inside any of the rooms. That is as good as not existing at all -- though we usually use the term &quot;out of play&quot; -- but as we will later see, it is possible to have things initially out of play but brought into existence later on.)
