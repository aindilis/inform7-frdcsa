New rulebooks</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Creating a new rulebook is also straightforward, as we see in the following modest example game:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Appraisal&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Passage is east of the Tomb. The green-eyed idol is in the Tomb. A Speak-Your-Progress machine is in the Passage.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Appraisal rules is a rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An appraisal rule: say &quot;Click... whirr... the score is [the score in words] points.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An appraisal rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if we have taken the idol, say &quot;Most importantly of all, the idol has been found.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The creation of the rulebook is all very well, but without the final sentence it would never be used. The crucial new phrase here is:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>follow </b>(rule)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_follow -->

<p>This phrase causes the rule to be obeyed immediately (rather than simply at predetermined times such as when a particular action is being tried, or at the end of every turn, and such). Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">follow the advance time rule;
<br>follow the appraisal rulebook;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>Like &quot;number&quot; or &quot;text&quot;, &quot;rule&quot; and &quot;rulebook&quot; are kinds of value built into Inform: &quot;the blossom rule&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rule&quot;, whereas &quot;the every turn rules&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rulebook&quot;. In fact, Inform considers a rulebook to be a special case of a rule, so that whenever a rule is required it is legal to name a rulebook instead, but not vice versa. The &quot;follow&quot; phrase here...
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...expects to be applied to a value of kind &quot;rule&quot;; &quot;the appraisal rules&quot; is in fact a rulebook, but since that counts as a rule the phrase makes sense to Inform. To follow a rulebook means to run through all its rules in turn, stopping when one rule reaches an outcome; to follow a single rule means just that one, of course.
<p>
<p>When created, a rulebook starts out with no rules in it - in this example, of course, we quickly defined a couple of rules to go into it. But it's often the case in Inform that a rulebook exists without ever being stocked up, especially if the rulebook is for some obscure purpose never needed. The built-in adjectives &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;non-empty&quot;, applied to a rulebook, test whether any rule is present or not.

<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You light [the noun] with [the flame source].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the heat of the noun is flaming.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of burning something when the player is in the noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;That seems dangerous given that you yourself are in [the noun].&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of burning something when the player is on the noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;That seems dangerous given that you yourself are on [the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Hm, the [printed name] appears to be [heat].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before taking a flaming thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let turns remaining be the endurance of the noun minus the turns of burning of the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if turns remaining is less than two, say &quot;There's no portion of [the noun] sufficiently cool for you to pick up.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>But that's only a small part of the battle. The thing about fire is that it keeps on doing fiery things even when the player is otherwise occupied: destroying items that are on fire, and spreading to other things nearby. So we need a set of rules for the fire's behavior.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when something is flaming:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow the fire rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The fire rules is a rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A fire rule (this is the can't hold flaming objects rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through flaming things:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the item is held by the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let turns remaining be the endurance of the item minus the turns of burning of the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if turns remaining is less than two:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The item] becomes too hot to hold! &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try dropping the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the item is held by the player, say &quot;This is certainly painful.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A fire rule (this is the flames spread rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through flaming things:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the turns of burning of the item is one:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spread the flames from the item.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A fire rule (this is the fire destroys things rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now started printing is false;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through flaming things:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increment the turns of burning of the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the turns of burning of the item is greater than the endurance of the item, destroy the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if started printing is true, say &quot;[paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now started printing is false.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Because we've labelled all the fire rules, we could swap their order, or turn some of them off, while allowing the others run as usual. For instance, if there were a pair of fireproof gloves in the game, we might want to turn off the &quot;can't hold flaming objects rule&quot; whenever the player is wearing them.
<p>
<p>This sort of flexibility is especially useful in the context of extensions. Someone writing an extension about burning would have no way of anticipating the need for a Fireproof Gauntlet of Thog, but the author would nonetheless be able to implement one easily.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is vulnerable if it is flammable and it is whole.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The contact between things is a critical factor when it comes to fire, so we might add a couple of conditional relations do determine what is touching what.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Reliance relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is part of Y or X is in Y or X is on Y. The verb to be relying on implies the reliance relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Contact relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is relying on Y or Y is relying on X. The verb to be joined to implies the contact relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Having these at our disposal makes it much tidier to write what happens next:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To spread the flames from (item - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now started printing is false;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the item is joined to a flammable whole thing (called the sacrifice):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the sacrifice is visible:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now started printing is true;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Flames engulf [the list of flammable whole things which are joined to the item].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now all the flammable whole things joined to the item are flaming.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Started printing is a truth state that varies. Started printing is false.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To destroy (item - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let home be the holder of the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the item is part of something (called the superstructure), let home be the holder of the superstructure;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the item is visible:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now started printing is true;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The item] burns away[if something is relying on the item], leaving [a list of things which are relying on the item] behind[end if]. &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if something is relying on the item,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now all the things which are relying on the item are in the home;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the item from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the item is damp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every flaming thing which is part of the item is damp.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To destroy (item - a door):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let home be the holder of the item;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if home is a room, now all of the flame-retardant parts of the item are in the home;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the item is damp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the item is open;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the item is unopenable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before printing the name of a damp door:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;burnt-out frame of &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of opening or closing a damp door:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] can no longer be opened or closed in any meaningful sense.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing something other than examining or dropping to a flaming thing when the turns of burning of the noun is greater than 1:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Fire has too thoroughly engulfed [the noun] for that to be a good idea.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking something when the noun is in a flaming thing (called the receptacle):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You don't quite dare reach into [the receptacle].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of touching something which is within a flaming thing (called the receptacle):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;It seems a little risky since [the receptacle] is on fire.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of turning something when the noun is contained in a flaming thing (called the receptacle):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;It seems a little risky since [the receptacle] is on fire.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of pushing or pulling something when the noun is inside a flaming thing (called the receptacle):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The receptacle] deters you.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before burning something which is in a container when the holder of the noun contains the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;This could make things toasty for you...&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And that completes the rules which cover burning: things can catch fire, fire will spread, and gradually consume the world in flames. All of that was general and could be used in any setting, but we now provide a small game to show it off.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Part II - Escape from the Library of the Dead
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Library of the Dead is a room. &quot;This room -- little, dank, stone -- is filling with some miasma you do not quite dare breathe. It is imperative that you get out.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The desk is a flammable supporter in the Library. A drawer is part of the desk. The drawer is a flammable closed container. It is openable, lockable, and locked. The desk is scenery.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A box is in the Library. A metal hinge is part of the box. The hinge is flame-retardant. The box is open, flammable, and openable. The shroud of Laertes is a flammable thing in the box.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining something when something is part of the noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You note [the list of things which are part of the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The world's last manuscript of the Psychagogoi by Aeschylus is on the desk. The manuscript is flammable. The manuscript has endurance 1.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The torch is a flammable flaming thing carried by the player. It has endurance 60. The asbestos sack is a flame-retardant player's holdall in the drawer.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The trapdoor is up of the Library and east of the Plaza. The trapdoor is a door. It is flammable, closed, lockable, and locked. &quot;A trapdoor in the ceiling is your only hope of escape[if flaming]. Fortunately, it is rapidly burning through[end if].&quot; The trapdoor has endurance 15.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going through the closed trapdoor, say &quot;[The trapdoor] is closed.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can then add a special fire rule to handle the trapdoor, which will be called as part of the same sequence. Again, this would be most important if the fire rules were part of a standard extension, and the trapdoor fire rule the author's own addition.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A fire rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the trapdoor is flaming and a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the caught thing be a random flammable whole thing which can be touched by the trapdoor;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the caught thing is a thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;A spark from [the trapdoor] catches [the caught thing]!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the caught thing is flaming.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going to the Plaza:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Out at last!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the story finally.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;get manuscript / get shroud / light desk / look / g / open drawer / look / g / g / g / get sack / put shroud in sack / put manuscript in sack / close sack / light trapdoor / look / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / up&quot;.
