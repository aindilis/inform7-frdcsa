Lighting</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>At any place (room, or inside a container) light is either fully present or fully absent. Inform does not usually try to track intermediate states of lighting, but see <b>The Undertomb 2</b> for a single lantern with varying light levels and <b>Zorn of Zorna</b> for multiple candles that can be lit for cumulative changes to the light level.
<p>
<p>Light can be added to, but not taken away: rooms and things can act as sources of light, by having the &quot;lighted&quot; and &quot;lit&quot; properties respectively, but they cannot be sinks which drain light away. The reason darkness is not a constant hazard in Inform-written games is that rooms always have the &quot;lighted&quot; property unless declared &quot;dark&quot;. (We assume daylight or some always-on electric lighting.) A &quot;dark&quot; room may well still be illuminated if a light source happens to be present:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Deep Crypt is a dark room. The candle lantern is a lit thing in the Deep Crypt.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p><b>Hymenaeus</b> allows us to explicitly refer to torches as &quot;lit&quot; or &quot;unlit&quot;, or (as synonyms) &quot;flaming&quot; or &quot;extinguished&quot;.
<p>
<p>For light produced electrically we might want a wall switch, as in <b>Down Below</b>, or a portable lamp, as in <b>The Dark Ages Revisited</b>.
<p>
<p>The fierce, locally confined light thrown out by a carried lamp has a quality quite unlike weak but ambient daylight, and <b>Reflections</b> exploits this to make a lantern feel more realistic.
<p>
<p>When the player experiences darkness in a location, Inform is usually very guarded in what it reveals. (&quot;It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.&quot;) <b>Hohmann Transfer</b> gives darkness a quite different look, and <b>Four Stars</b> heightens the other senses so that a player in darkness can still detect her surroundings. The first of the two examples in <b>Peeled</b> allows exploration of a dark place by touch.
<p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to check whether a room that is not the current location happens to contain a light source or be naturally lighted. This poses a few challenges. <b>Unblinking</b> demonstrates one way of doing this, so long as there are no backdrop light sources.
<p>
<p><b>Cloak of Darkness</b> is a short and sweet game based on a light puzzle.
