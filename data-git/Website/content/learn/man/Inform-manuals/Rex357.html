Scene Changes</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>In a plot that takes place over multiple locations or has several distinct scenes, we may want to move the player or change the scenery around him. <b>Age of Steam</b> brings a train on and off-stage as the plot requires. <b>Meteoric</b> similarly brings a meteor into view at a certain time of day, showing off several implementations depending on whether or not the player is supposed to be able to refer to the meteor after it has gone.
<p>
<p><b>Entrevaux</b> constructs an organized system such that all scenes have their own lists of props and associated locations, and props are moved on and off automatically. Scene changes are also announced with a pause and a new title, such as &quot;Chapter 2: Abduction&quot;.
<p>
<p><b>Space Patrol - Stranded on Jupiter</b> inserts an interlude in which the player's possessions and clothes are switched for new ones and the player moved to a new location - and then put back where he started from.

<p>The following source is very short and simple, yet it already feels surprisingly interesting in play, because something is going on which the player does not control but must observe. The single scene both starts and finishes.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Age of Steam&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Station is a room. &quot;Eynforme Halt is a raised platform fringed with cowslip: a whistle-stop with no more than a signal and a water-tank.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Flying Scotsman is fixed in place. &quot;The Flying Scotsman, fastest train in the world, is now at a dead standstill.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Train Stop is a scene. Train Stop begins when the player is in the Station for the third turn. Train Stop ends when the time since Train Stop began is 3 minutes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Train Stop begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the Flying Scotsman to the Station;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The Flying Scotsman pulls up at the platform, to a billow of steam and hammering.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Train Stop ends:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the Flying Scotsman from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The Flying Scotsman inches away, with a squeal of released brakes, gathering speed invincibly until it disappears around the hill. All is abruptly still once more.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of entering the Flying Scotsman, say &quot;Alas, the [time when Train Stop began] arrival is only to take on water, not to set down or pick up.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;z / z / z / enter flying scotsman / z / z&quot;.
