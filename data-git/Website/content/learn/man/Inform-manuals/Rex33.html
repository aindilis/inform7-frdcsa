<p>There are no recipes for testing, alas, although most experienced IF authors have their preferred ways of going about it. Briefly: the best advice is to build and maintain a Skein which holds complete play-throughs of the piece, so that it is easy to check with a single click that all is still well; to have beta-testers who play through (substantial) drafts and send back their transcripts of play, along with suggestions; and to listen to these suggestions, and treat the beta-testers as editors rather than galley slaves.
<p>
<p><b>Alpha</b> shows a way to gracefully accept beta-testers' annotations without advancing time in the game.
<p>
<p>Most large works of IF have historically provided secret commands for testing and debugging - commands removed (or sometimes accidentally not) in the final released product. Inform does this automatically: the commands SHOWME, ACTIONS and SCENES are always present except in a released story file. It also allows us to write passages of source text which apply only for the testing phase, so that we can define new testing commands, or other checks that all is well: <b>Bic</b> demonstrates this, and is also useful in its own right.

<p>It may occasionally be useful to check whether all objects in our game have a given property. Here we have a &quot;not for release&quot; section that will run at the start of the game and alert us to any objects lacking description:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Bic&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 1 - Testing descriptions - Not for release

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[item] has no description.&quot;
