<p>
<p>By default, Inform gives the player character (and every other person) a simple unitary body, one without hands or feet or any other defined parts. In many games this is adequate; but in others it is not enough, and we may want to endow all people with some more specific physical features, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A face is a kind of thing. A face is part of every person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Once we've done this, we may invite ambiguities if the player types LOOK AT FACE; it is this challenge that is addressed in <b>The Night Before</b>.
<p>
<p><b>rBGH</b> gives the player a random height and then uses this to determine how the room should be described around him.
<p>
<p><b>Slouching</b> lets the player (and other characters as well) take different sitting, standing, and lying down positions.

<a name="e346"><a href=Rdoc23.html#e346 STYLE="text-decoration: none">**<b><b>Example</b> 381:  Slouching</b></a><br>A system of postures allowing the player and other characters to sit, stand, or lie down explicitly or implicitly on a variety of enterable supporters or containers, or in location.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we want to let the player explicitly sit, stand, or lie down on different enterable objects. (Normally Inform treats all these actions as entering, but there may be cases where we want to distinguish between the player sitting on a chair and the player standing on it.)
<p>
<p>Our implementation gives each kind of enterable a range of allowed postures, and one preferred posture. If the player enters the supporter or container without specifying a posture (as in ENTER CHAIR), he will be put in the preferred posture. If he explicitly says, e.g., STAND ON CHAIR, he will be put in the standing position as long as standing is a posture that suits the chair.
