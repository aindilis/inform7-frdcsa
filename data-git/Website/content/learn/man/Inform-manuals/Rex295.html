<p>
<p>Since we prefer not to simulate burnt skin, and it is unsporting to kill a player outright merely for touching a hot object, heat is mostly used as a reason why something cannot be picked up at a given moment. This very basic puzzle is demonstrated in <b>Grilling</b>.
<p>
<p>With the naked eye, it is not always easy to detect what is too hot to touch - a point made in both <b>Masochism Deli</b>, where the only solution is to keep picking up potatoes until one doesn't burn, and in <b>Hot Glass Looks Like Cold Glass</b>, where infrared goggles turn the scales.
<p>
<p>If a hot object is not to be touched, will it stay hot forever? It might well, if it is a steak on an electric grill, but not if it is a recently-baked apple pie sitting on a window-sill. <b>Entropy</b> simulates the gradual return of temperature to equilibrium.

<a name="e295"><a href=Rdoc88.html#e295 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 315:  Masochism Deli</b></a><br>Multiple potatoes, with rules to make the player drop the hot potato first and pick it up last.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Here the player has several potatoes; we would like to make him more likely to drop the hot one, and more likely to pick up the cold one, all else being equal. At the same time, we want to phrase our rules so that they don't make the player try to take something he's already holding, or drop something he isn't.
<p>
<p>So:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Masochism Deli&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Masochism Deli is a room. &quot;Recent restructurings of corporate policy restrict the 'lunch hour' to exactly thirty-two minutes, which means that no one has time to go out. Instead, you and your coworkers eat here, in the company's very own themed lunch room.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The plural of potato is potatoes. A potato is a kind of thing. A potato is edible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Temperature is a kind of value. The temperatures are hot and cold. A potato has a temperature. A potato is usually cold.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the temperature property as describing a potato. Before printing the name of a potato (called subject): say &quot;[temperature of subject] &quot;. Before printing the plural name of a potato (called subject): say &quot;[temperature of subject] &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Does the player mean dropping a hot potato which is carried by the player: it is very likely.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Does the player mean taking a cold potato which is not carried by the player: it is very likely.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries three potatoes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After dropping a hot potato:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The guy from Cube B sneers at your lack of potato-holding stamina.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: now a random potato is hot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
