<p>
<p>Fire exhibits some of the properties of a gas: it is only vaguely located and tends to spread out, though it passes by touch rather than on the air. It is hazardous to life, through direct contact, heat, and smoke. Better governed, it provides light and warmth. Worse governed, it consumes almost anything it comes into contact with. Here the problem with &quot;debris&quot; is not so much that we need potentially hundreds of new objects to represent broken items: instead, fire could sweep through a work of IF destroying so much that no play is possible any longer. Setting up a problem in which the player must defeat a fully-capable fire is difficult to balance.
<p>
<p>As with liquids, it is best to simulate the least amount of fire that the design will allow. <b>Bruneseau's Journey</b> provides a single candle which can be lit, or blown out, but where fire can never transfer from the candle's end to anything else - or vice versa: the player's source of fire, with which to light the candle, is discreetly neglected.
<p>
<p>In the more realistic <b>Thirst 2</b>, a campfire is lit using a tinderbox, so that fire does transfer from one thing (tinder) to another (the campfire): but it is always confined to just these two items, and can be used only for light and warmth.
<p>
<p><b>The Cow Exonerated</b> provides a class of matches that can light any flammable object, but assumes that burning objects requires only one turn; lighting one thing does not burn another.
<p>
<p><b>In Fire or in Flood</b> provides a complete simulation of what we might call &quot;wild-fire&quot;: combustion which spreads through arbitrary objects and rooms, destroying all in its path.

<a name="e95"><a href=Rdoc87.html#e95 STYLE="text-decoration: none">**<b><b>Example</b> 407:  The Cow Exonerated</b></a><br>Creating a class of matches that burn for a time and then go out, with elegant reporting when several matches go out at once.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Here we create a class of matches that can be used to burn other objects. Our objectives are as follow:
<p>
<p>Burned objects other than matches should be removed from play instantly (just as edible objects are instantly eaten). We could give everything its own burning duration, but that complicates matters and allows for fire to spread from one object to another; for an example of how to do that, see the example &quot;In Fire or in Flood&quot;.
<p>
<p>Matches should be described to show whether they are burning or extinguished, and when the parser chooses one of several identical matches, it should make very clear which match it has selected.
<p>
<p>The game must sensibly select and, if necessary, automatically light new matches to carry out a >BURN THING command.
<p>
<p>The matches must burn for a set number of turns before going out, never to be used again.
<p>
<p>And finally, the part for which the indexed text will be useful: when several matches go out in the same turn, we want the game to print
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Four matches go out.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>rather than
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A match goes out.
<br>A match goes out.
<br>A match goes out.
<br>A match goes out.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This last function appears down in Section 3, if we wish to skip ahead and look at it.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The word &quot;matches&quot; is used by Inform to compare snippets of text (see &quot;Reading a command&quot; in the Activities chapter). This can sometimes cause awkwardness if we also have a kind called &quot;match&quot;, so for the occasion we will give our matches a more specialized name, never visible to the player:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A strikable-match is a kind of thing. The plural of strikable-match is s-matches.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A strikable-match has a number called duration. The duration of a strikable-match is usually 3.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of a strikable-match: say &quot;match&quot;.
