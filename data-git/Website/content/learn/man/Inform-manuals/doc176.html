<p>The next control phrase is &quot;while&quot;, which has the form:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>while </b>(a condition)<b></b><i>:</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_while -->

<p>This phrase causes the block of phrases following it to be repeated over and over for as long the condition is true. If it isn't even true the first time, the block is skipped over and nothing happens. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">while someone (called the victim) is in the Crypt:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;A bolt of lightning strikes [the victim]!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the victim is in the Afterlife;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>We must be careful not to commit mistakes like the following:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">while eggs is eggs:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;again and &quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which, as sure as eggs is eggs (which is very sure indeed), writes out
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">again and again and again and again and again and ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>forever. (Inform won't prevent this: we will find out the hard way when the game is played.) While we would probably never write anything so blatant as that, the mistake is all too easy to commit in disguised form. We should never design a loop, as repetitions like this are called, without worrying about if and when it will finish.
<p>
<p>As with &quot;if&quot;, we can use &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot; instead of a tabulated layout if we want to --
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">while ...
<br>begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>end while.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(The &quot;begin&quot; of an &quot;if&quot; must of course match an &quot;end if&quot;, not an &quot;end while&quot;, and so on.)
<p>
<p><hr><img border=&quot;0&quot; src=images/beta.png id=&quot;betaoval&quot; style=&quot;height:31px; width=40px&quot;>Previous builds allowed two other forms:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #c00000; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>while </b>(a condition)<b> repeatedly </b>(a phrase)<b></b><br><i>or:</i> <b>while </b>(a condition)<b> , </b>(a phrase)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_while_dep -->

<p>This phrase causes the single phrase following it to be repeated over and over for as long the condition is true. If it isn't even true the first time, nothing is done at all. These forms of &quot;while&quot; are now deprecated, and should be replaced by the standard block form:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">while (a condition):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>Experience shows that it is much more legible to lay out &quot;while&quot; loops as blocks, even in these rare cases when only a single phrase forms the body of the block.
