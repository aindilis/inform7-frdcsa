<p>In a poem, or in a novel, exact scientific measurements are not the point. So a writer who wants to set up ways to describe the sky at different times might go for something like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The sky can be cadmium, mackerel, overcast or cornflower.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And nobody is interested in the sun angle, the percentage of cloud cover, or any of the other numbers behind all of this. Similarly, if we walk into a familiar office which has been disturbed, we might well say &quot;Look! The filing cabinet is in the middle of the floor.&quot; We are not likely to exclaim &quot;Look! The filing cabinet is 1.2m from the east wall and 2.1m from the north wall.&quot;
<p>
<p>But some writers of interactive fiction do like to make use of physical realism. For instance, it's easier to forbid a bulky object being taken through a narrow doorway if there is a way to measure and compare sizes.
<p>
<p>Most computer programs write numbers in the same way, whatever they're used for. But human beings don't. If someone says &quot;How far is Duluth?&quot;, we're more likely to say &quot;100 miles&quot; than just &quot;100&quot;. This is a useful feature of natural language, because it means we always know how to translate that number into reality - it's 100 miles, not 100 km, or 100 inches; and it's definitely a distance, not 100 apples or 100 kilograms.
<p>
<p>Inform lets us use plain numbers if we want to, but it also allows us to create numerical kinds of value:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A distance is a kind of value. 5 miles specifies a distance.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>That kind of definition, and the consequences, will be the subject of this chapter. But we will first look a little harder at the numerical kind of value we get for free: &quot;number&quot;.
