<p>
<p>We are allowed to link the beginning or end of any scene to the beginning or end of any other scene. So, for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Luggage Trouble is a scene. Luggage Trouble begins when Brief Encounter begins.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Thus the two scenes run concurrently, at least for a while. We can also add that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Luggage Trouble ends when Brief Encounter ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This can be useful when a large, complicated scene really contains several smaller sub-scenes.
<p>
<p>A special exceptional case is that we can have any scene or scenes starting right at the outset:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Railway Meeting is a scene. Railway Meeting begins when play begins.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>When play ends, of course, all scenes end, so there is no need to say that.

<p>
<p>Suppose we want to remind the player that he doesn't have all the time in the world, by starting to nag him when he's nearly, but not entirely, done going over his inventory in preparation for a job.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;The Prague Job&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be seen or unseen. A thing is usually unseen. Carry out examining: now the noun is seen.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a lockpick, a smoke bomb, a grappling hook, and a pair of gloves. The description of the lockpick is &quot;Effective on most kinds of key locks, it is a gift from your mentor in the discipline, old Wheezy.&quot; The description of the smoke bomb is &quot;Your last of these, so you should rely on it only when other modes of escape have vanished. It takes effect when dropped, producing a cloud of purple haze sufficient to fill a medium-sized room.&quot; The description of the grappling hook is &quot;Good for shooting at balconies and other sorts of overhang.&quot;  The gloves are wearable. The description of the gloves is &quot;Black and shiny, with gripping material on the palms. Batman would be jealous.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Toilet is a room. &quot;The walls are painted an unattractive green; the fixtures are a bit old. But it is the only place in the hostel with any privacy.&quot; The Long Hallway is outside from the Toilet.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Reviewing Possessions is a scene. Reviewing Possessions begins when play begins.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Escalating Danger is a scene. Reviewing Possessions ends when Escalating Danger begins. Escalating Danger begins when preparations near completion.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide whether preparations near completion:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if at least two of the things which are carried by the player are seen, yes;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Escalating Danger begins: say &quot;Someone pounds on the door of your hideout and yells at you in Czech.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going from the Toilet during Reviewing Possessions: say &quot;You need to go over your equipment first, and make sure you're ready here.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going from the Toilet during Escalating Danger: say &quot;You're not done checking over your materials.&quot;

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn during Escalating Danger: if the time since Escalating Danger began is greater than 1 minute, say &quot;Impatient footsteps pass your door again.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Escalating Danger ends when every thing which is carried by the player is seen. When Escalating Danger ends, say &quot;There -- nothing damaged or torn. You're ready to go.&quot;
