Varying What Is Written</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Before getting to actual recipes, many recipe books begin with intimidating lists of high-end kitchen equipment (carbon-steel pans, a high-temperature range, a Provencal shallot-grater, a set of six pomegranate juicers): fortunately, readers who have downloaded Inform already have the complete kitchen used by the authors. But the other traditional preliminaries, about universal skills such as chopping vegetables, boiling water and measuring quantities, do have an equivalent.
<p>
<p>For us, the most basic technique of IF is to craft the text so that it smoothly and elegantly adapts to describe the situation, disguising the machine which is never far beneath the surface. This means using text substitutions so that any response likely to be seen more than once or twice will vary.
<p>
<p><b>M. Melmoth's Duel</b> demonstrates three basic techniques: an ever-changing random variation, a random variation changing only after the player has been absent for a while, and a message tweaked to add an extra comment in one special case. (Random choices can be quite specifically constrained, as <b>Ahem</b> shows in passing.) <b>Fifty Ways to Leave Your Larva</b> and <b>Fifty Times Fifty Ways</b> show how a generic message can be given a tweak to make it a better fit for the person it currently talks about. <b>Curare</b> picks out an item carried by the player to work into a message, trying to make an apt rather than random choice. <b>Straw Into Gold</b> demonstrates how to have Inform parrot back the player's choice of name for an object.
<p>
<p>Another reason to vary messages is to avoid unnatural phrasing. <b>Odins</b> carefully avoids a giveaway grammatical blunder - the kind only a computer would make. <b>Ballpark</b> turns needlessly precise numbers - another computerish trait - into more idiomatic English. (Likewise <b>Numberless</b>, though it is really an example demonstrating how to split behaviour into many cases.) <b>Prolegomena</b> shows how to use these vaguer quantifiers any time Inform describes a group of objects (as in &quot;You can see 27 paper clips here.&quot;).
<p>
<p><b>Blink</b>, a short but demanding example from the extreme end of <i>Writing with Inform</i>, shows how the basic text variation mechanisms of Inform can themselves be extended. <b>Blackout</b> demonstrates text manipulation at a lower level, replacing every letter of a room name with &quot;*&quot; when the player is in darkness.
<p>
<p>A few of Inform's included extensions provide extra control over text output, as well: Complex Listing allows us more control over the order and presentation of lists of items, and Plurality provides functions for handling pronouns and objects whose names might be understood as singular or plural.
<p>
<p>The extension Case Management used to be used for changing the case of something printed, but it is now included chiefly to support older Inform projects: now the best way to change printed text to upper, lower, sentence, or title casing is to use indexed text, as demonstrated in <b>Rocket Man</b>.

<a name="e362"><a href=Rdoc5.html#e362 STYLE="text-decoration: none">***<b><b>Example</b> 294:  Straw Into Gold</b></a><br>Creating a Rumpelstiltskin character who is always referred to as "dwarf", "guy", "dude", or "man" -- depending on which the player last used -- until the first time the player refers to him as "Rumpelstiltskin".<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;Straw Into Gold&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Cell is a room. Rumpelstiltskin is an improper-named man in the Cell.  Rumpelstiltskin can be identified or unidentified. Rumpelstiltskin is unidentified.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">R-name is a kind of value. The R-names are dwarf, guy, dude, and man-thing. Rumpelstiltskin has an R-name. Understand &quot;[R-name]&quot; as Rumpelstiltskin.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Our example is slightly complicated by the fact that &quot;man&quot; is a name already known to Inform, so we can't re-use it as a kind of value. This is possible to work around, though:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;man&quot; as man-thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we borrow from the Activities chapter to look at the exact wording of the player's command:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command includes &quot;[R-name]&quot;,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the R-name of Rumpelstiltskin is the R-name understood;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command includes &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot;:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now Rumpelstiltskin is identified;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now Rumpelstiltskin is proper-named.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of Rumpelstiltskin when Rumpelstiltskin is unidentified:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the R-name of Rumpelstiltskin is man-thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;man&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[R-name]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x dwarf / x guy / x dude / look / x rumpelstiltskin / look / x man&quot;.
