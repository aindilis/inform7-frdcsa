<p>The &quot;device&quot; kind provides for the simplest form of machine: one which is, at any given moment, switched on or switched off. Inform looks after this state, but leaves it to us to make the machine actually do something:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The air-conditioning unit is a device in the Florist's Shop. The air-conditioning is fixed in place and switched on.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when in the Florist's Shop:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the air-conditioning is switched off, say &quot;You worry about the cut flowers in this jungle-hot air.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;There is an low susurration from the air-conditioning unit.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>One primary dictionary definition for a machine is &quot;an apparatus using or applying mechanical power and having several parts&quot;, and we often use the &quot;part of&quot; relationship to build machinery. <b>Control Center</b> provides a neat way to display the component parts of a machine to the player who examines it.
<p>
<p>One component almost always part of an electrical machine is the (literal) switch, lever or button to control whether they are switched on or off. In <b>Model Shop</b> just such an on/off button is automatically made part of every device.
<p>
<p>While an electrical device has only two states, a mechanical machine might have many, and for these the best approach is to define a kind of value naming the possibilities: see <b>Signs and Portents</b>, where the states are the possible destinations pointed towards.
<p>
<p>Perhaps stretching the definition of &quot;machine&quot;, <b>What Makes You Tick</b> demonstrates a fishing pole which the player can put together from several pieces.

<a name="e339"><a href=Rdoc75.html#e339 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 61:  Control Center</b></a><br>Objects which automatically include a description of their component parts whenever they are examined.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>It is straightforward to make a rule that anything with parts must mention all those parts during an EXAMINE command:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Control Center&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After examining a thing when something is part of the noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] includes [a list of things which are part of the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Control Center is a room. &quot;Here you are at the Control Center of the universe.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Universe Management Computer is a fixed in place thing in the Control Center. &quot;The Universe Management Computer sits directly before you, unguarded.&quot; The description of the Universe Management Computer is &quot;The computer is so large that you would be unable to operate it all from one position. Alas, it does not come with a manual.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A chartreuse indicator light, an ennui meter, a golden knob settable to 15,000 positions, a toothpick dispenser, and a button labeled RESTART are part of the Universe Management Computer.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The command chair is an enterable supporter in the Control Center. It is pushable between rooms. &quot;Because the computer is too large for you to reach all of the front panel from a standing position, there is a command chair on casters which allows you to push back and forth.&quot; The description of the command chair is &quot;Quite ordinary, really, but for the heady rush of power that comes of sitting in it.&quot;. Some casters are part of the command chair.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now whenever we look at any object with components, we will first see the description, then a list of parts which belong to it. The following refinement brings in elements of later chapters, but it may be worth noting: because we've written our rule as an &quot;After examining...&quot;, anything that pre-empts the operation of the examine command will also prevent that rule from occurring. So for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hair-thick needle is part of the ennui meter.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the ennui meter: say &quot;You can't be bothered.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...would not result in the needle being mentioned.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x chair / x computer / x ennui meter&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
