<p>
<p>Sometimes we want Inform to apply a player's action to a different target than the one specified: for instance, directing all (or almost all) commands from the doorknob to the door of which it is a part. <b>Fine Laid</b> demonstrates how to do this. Along the same lines, <b>Lucy</b> shows how to direct a player's conversation action to apply to a new conversation topic.
<p>
<p>We can also record a series of actions performed by the player or by another character.
<p>
<p><b>Cactus Will Outlive Us All</b> demonstrates characters each of whom reacts to a very specific provocation; <b>I Didn't Come All The Way From Great Portland Street</b> implements a game show in which the player is not allowed ever to repeat an action he has already performed; and <b>Leopard-skin</b> implements a maze which the player can escape only by performing a specific sequence of actions.
<p>
<p><b>Anteaters</b> provides a peculiar gizmo that can remember actions performed in its presence and force the player to reiterate them.

<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;Cactus Will Outlive Us All&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Death Valley is a room. Luckless Luke and Dead-Eye Pete are men in the Valley. A cactus is in the Valley. Persuasion rule: persuasion succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person has a stored action called death knell. The death knell of Luckless Luke is the action of pulling the cactus. The death knell of Dead-Eye Pete is the action of Luke trying dropping the cactus.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before an actor doing something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with the victim running through people in the location:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the DK be the death knell of the victim;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the DK is not waiting and the current action is the DK:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;It looks as if [the DK] was the death knell for [the victim], who looks startled, then nonexistent.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the victim from play.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we leave it at that, then pulling the cactus will kill Luckless Luke but then say &quot;Nothing obvious happens.&quot;, which seems like a bit of an anti-climax. So we add a special case response for that one:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After pulling the cactus when Luckless Luke was in the location:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;That's a real shame.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;get cactus / drop cactus / luke, get cactus / luke, drop cactus / pull cactus / look&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
