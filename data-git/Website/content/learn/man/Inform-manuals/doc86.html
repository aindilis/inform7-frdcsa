<p>
<p>It is in describing circumstances that Inform really capitalises on the concise, expressive power of natural language, and this chapter brings together the facts about &quot;descriptions&quot;.
<p>
<p>The simplest descriptions consist of a noun alone. Some refer to single things (&quot;lantern&quot;, or &quot;wine cask&quot;), others to kinds of thing (&quot;dead end&quot; or &quot;container&quot;). But we have also seen adjectives alone:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The oaken desk is <b>fixed in place</b>.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here, &quot;fixed in place&quot; is a description which, to Inform's simple-minded grammar, is a single adjective. And of course adjectives and nouns can be combined:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The cargo trunk is an <b>openable container</b>.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The description &quot;openable container&quot; consists of the noun &quot;container&quot;, meaning a kind of thing, and the adjective &quot;openable&quot;, which means one of the two possible states of an either/or property held by that thing.
<p>
<p>As the next chapter will show, rules also make great use of descriptions:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of throwing <b>something</b> at a <b>closed openable door</b>, say &quot;Or you could just use the handle like anyone else, of course.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We have already seen that we can list the items fitting a given description:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;You look down at [the list of <b>things in the basket</b>].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>It's also sometimes convenient to count them up:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>number of </b>(description of values)<b></b> ... <i>number</i><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_numberof -->

<p>This phrase counts the number of values matching the description, which may of course be 0. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">number of open doors
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>produces the number of doors, anywhere in the model world, which are currently open. A Problem message is produced if the number is potentially infinite, or impractical to count: for instance, Inform rejects &quot;number of odd numbers&quot;.
<p>

<p>
<p>It is because descriptions are so widely useful that they deserve a chapter of their own, and this is it.
