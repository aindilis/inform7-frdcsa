<p>IF is difficult to play: often harder than the writer ever suspects. Players are held up by what is &quot;obvious&quot;, and they stumble into unforeseen combinations, or spend inordinate amounts of time working on the &quot;wrong&quot; problems. Too much of this and they give up, or post questions on online forums. Against this, many IF authors like to include in-game hints.
<p>
<p>There are many approaches, which differ on two main issues.
<p>
<p>First: do we spontaneously offer help to the player? The difficulty here is detecting the player's need: <b>Y ask Y?</b> tries to spot aimlessness, while <b>Solitude</b> has a novice mode where it is reasonable to assume that help is almost always needed. On the other hand, suppose we require that the initiative come from the player. Will a novice know to type HELP? <b>Responding to questions starting with WHO, WHAT, etc.</b> shows how to redirect any attempt to ask a direct question into a HELP request. At the other end of the scale, wearily experienced players may type HELP all the time, out of habit, cheating themselves of the fun of frustration: if so, <b>Real Adventurers Need No Help</b> provides the nicotine patch against this addiction.
<p>
<p>Second: how do we decide what help is needed? Normally the player only types HELP, which is unspecific. The simplest approach offers a menu, diagnosing the player's problem by obliging him to make choices: see <b>Food Network Interactive</b>. Listing all the possible problems in the game may give away too much, though, since players may not have reached the puzzles in question yet; so some authors prefer to create menus that adapt to the current state of the game (commonly called &quot;adaptive hints&quot;). None of the examples demonstrate this variation because it can be a bit long-winded to set up, but several adaptive hint extensions are available for Inform.
<p>
<p>Failing this, we can also try to parse commands like HELP ABOUT MICRODOT, as in <b>Ish.</b> <b>Trieste</b> takes a similar tack, except that instead of offering hints about puzzles, it offers help on game features (such as how to save), and lists all the available topics if the player types simply HELP.
<p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most stylishly, we can try to deduce what the player is stuck on from his immediate circumstances and from what is not yet solved: this needs a powerful adaptive hints system like the one in <b>The Unexamined Life</b>.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose we have an action called &quot;asking for help&quot; that gives the player some hints on request. We've also made it possible to turn this feature off, if the player would like to discourage himself from using the hints too much. Now we need a value that varies to keep track of whether hints are currently permitted or currently not permitted. So we might write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Real Adventurers Need No Help&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A permission is a kind of value. The permissions are allowed and denied.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Hint usage is a permission that varies. Hint usage is allowed.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And under the right circumstances, we change hint usage to denied:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check asking for help for the first time:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Sometimes the temptation to rely on hints becomes overwhelming, and you may prefer to turn off hints now. If you do so, your further requests for guidance will be unavailing. Turn off hints? >&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if player consents:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now hint usage is denied;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[line break]Truly, a real adventurer does not need hints.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Then we can refer back to this value later to decide whether we want to display the hint menu or not:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check asking for help:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if hint usage is denied, say &quot;You have chosen to eschew hints in this game. Be strong! Persevere!&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Asking for help is an action out of world. Understand &quot;help&quot; or &quot;hint&quot; or &quot;hints&quot; as asking for help.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Realm of Terribly Unjust Puzzles is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out asking for help:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Fine, since you're weak enough to ask: here is a complete walkthrough: GET EGG. PEEL EGG. SMELL EGG. DIVIDE YOLK INTO THREE PORTIONS. GIVE THE SMALLEST PORTION OF YOLK TO THE GOLDEN GOOSE. ASK THE GOOSE ABOUT WHETHER THE SWAN IS TO BE TRUSTED. GIVE THE LARGEST PORTION OF YOLK TO THE SWAN. DANCE CONGA. EAT MEDIUM PORTION. STAND ON HEAD. WEST.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;hint&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that it would probably be kinder to offer the player some intermediate level of help, in the actual event.
