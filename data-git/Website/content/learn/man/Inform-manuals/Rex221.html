<p>
<p>Sometimes we want Inform to apply a player's action to a different target than the one specified: for instance, directing all (or almost all) commands from the doorknob to the door of which it is a part. <b>Fine Laid</b> demonstrates how to do this. Along the same lines, <b>Lucy</b> shows how to direct a player's conversation action to apply to a new conversation topic.
<p>
<p>We can also record a series of actions performed by the player or by another character.
<p>
<p><b>Cactus Will Outlive Us All</b> demonstrates characters each of whom reacts to a very specific provocation; <b>I Didn't Come All The Way From Great Portland Street</b> implements a game show in which the player is not allowed ever to repeat an action he has already performed; and <b>Leopard-skin</b> implements a maze which the player can escape only by performing a specific sequence of actions.
<p>
<p><b>Anteaters</b> provides a peculiar gizmo that can remember actions performed in its presence and force the player to reiterate them.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e221"><a href=Rdoc42.html#e221 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 419:  Leopard-skin</b></a><br>A maze that the player can escape if he performs an exact sequence of actions.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>Suppose (as in Infocom's Leather Goddesses of Phobos) that we have a maze that the player can escape only by performing the correct sequence of actions in the correct order. One way to do this would be to keep a list of the player's most recent actions, and see whether these match up with the combination we have established as the maze's solution.
<p>
<p>For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &quot;Leopard-skin&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Fur-Lined Maze is a room. &quot;This seemingly endless sequence of rooms is decorated in a tasteful selection of exotic furs and gilded fixtures.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Clapping is an action applying to nothing. Understand &quot;clap&quot; as clapping.
<br>Kweepaing is an action applying to nothing. Understand &quot;kweepa&quot; as kweepaing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out clapping:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You clap.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out kweepaing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You holler 'KWEEPA!' triumphantly.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The maze-sequence is a list of stored actions that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add the action of jumping to the maze-sequence;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add the action of clapping to the maze-sequence;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add the action of kweepaing to the maze-sequence.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The attempted-sequence is a list of stored actions that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when the player is in the Fur-Lined Maze:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truncate the attempted-sequence to the last two entries;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add the current action to the attempted-sequence;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the attempted-sequence is the maze-sequence:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;That does it! You are instantly transported from the maze!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the story finally.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;hop / clap / clap / hop / kweepa / hop / clap / kweepa&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
