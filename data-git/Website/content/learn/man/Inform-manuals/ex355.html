<p>
<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> &quot;Scope&quot; is a term of art in interactive fiction programming: it means the collection of things which can be interacted with at any given moment, which depends on who you are and where you are. Commands typed by the player will only be allowed to go forward into actions if the things they refer to are &quot;in scope&quot;. Inform also needs to determine scope at other times, too: for instance, when deciding whether a rule conditional on being &quot;in the presence of&quot; something is valid. It is a bad idea to say anything during this activity.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> Is complicated: see the Inform Designer's Manual, 4th edition, page 227. Briefly, the scope for someone consists of everything in the same place as them, unless it is dark.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) We very rarely want to forbid the player to refer to things close at hand, but often want to allow references to distant ones. For instance, a mirage of something which is not present at all:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while in the Shrine: place the holy grail in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Two different phrases enable us to place unusual items in scope:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>place </b>(object)<b> in scope</b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_placeinscope -->

<p>This phrase should only be used in rules for the &quot;deciding the scope of...&quot; activity. It places the given object in scope, making it accessible to the player's commands, regardless of where it is in the model world. Examples:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">place the distant volcano in scope;
<br>place the lacquered box in scope, but not its contents;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Ordinarily if something is placed in scope, then so are its parts and (in the case of a supporter or a transparent or open container) its contents; using the &quot;but not its contents&quot; option we can place just the box itself in scope.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>place the</b>/--<b> contents of </b>(object)<b> in scope</b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_placecontentsinscope -->

<p>This phrase should only be used in rules for the &quot;deciding the scope of...&quot; activity. It places the things inside or on top of the given object in scope, making them accessible to the player's commands, but it does nothing to place the object itself in scope. (It might of course be in scope anyway, and if it is then this phrase won't remove it.) Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">place the contents of the lacquered box in scope;
<br>place the contents of the Marbled Steps in scope;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that the object in question can be a room, as in this second example.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>(b) Another useful device is to be able to see, but not touch, another room:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Cloakroom is a room. &quot;This is just a cloakroom, but through a vague, misty mirror-window you can make out the Beyond.&quot; After looking in the Cloakroom, say &quot;In the mirror you can see [list of things in the Beyond].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while in the Cloakroom: place the Beyond in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Beyond is a room. Johnny Depp is a man in the Beyond.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(This must, however, also be a mirage, as at time of writing Mr Depp is alive and as well as can be expected following the reviews of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.) When a room is placed in scope, this is understood as placing its contents in scope rather than the room-object itself. So &quot;place the Ballroom in scope&quot; allows the player to talk about the dancers, the chamber musicians and so forth, but not to &quot;EXAMINE BALLROOM&quot; as such. (This is sensible because actions like examining apply to things: and a room, unlike a container or a supporter, is not a kind of thing.)
<p>
<p>(c) In darkness, the scope of someone is ordinarily restricted to his or her possessions (and body), but we can override that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while in darkness: place the location in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p><b>4. A note about actions.</b> This activity takes place during the process of understanding the player's command, when the action that will take place is not fully known. So if the player types &quot;TAKE SHOEBOX&quot;, this activity would happen when SHOEBOX is being examined for meaning. Inform knows the action it would be taking if the current line of command grammar were to be accepted, but it does not yet know to what objects that command would be applied. That means attaching a proviso like &quot;... while taking a container&quot; to a rule for this activity will cause the rule to have no effect - whereas &quot;... while taking&quot; would be fine.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Chapter 1 - Laying Out Rooms

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A room can be indoors or outdoors.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use full-length room descriptions.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with the way running through directions:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let first step be the room the way from the location;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place the first step in scope;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let second step be the room the way from the first step;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second step is a room, place the second step in scope;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place the obelisk in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The obelisk is so large that it can be seen from every room. If we had a number of such large monuments we might want to write a systematic routine to handle them, but this will do for now.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The room description heading rule is not listed in the carry out looking rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now, we set things up so that the surrounding areas are described automatically as part of the room description:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Building description is a truth state that varies. Building description is false.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After looking when the location is an outdoors room:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now count of sentences is 0;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now building description is true;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with way running through directions:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let space be the room way from the location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if space is an outdoors room, silently try looking toward space;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obelisk is not in the location and the obelisk is unmentioned:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the way be the best route from location to the Upper Terrace;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the way is a direction, say &quot;[The obelisk] is proudly visible on [the way] horizon. [run paragraph on]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increment the count of sentences;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now building description is false;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say paragraph break.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But perhaps there are a few rooms where we do not wish that to happen, so we'll build in exceptions for those.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After looking in the rose garden:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Otherwise, you are quite cut off.&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After looking in the Ha-ha:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And suppose we want to allow the player to look in any direction:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;look [direction]&quot; or &quot;look to/toward [direction]&quot; as facing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Facing is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out facing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the viewed item be the room noun from the location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the viewed item is not a room:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location is indoors, say &quot;Your view is restricted by the lack of doors or windows in that direction.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;You can't see anything promising that way.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try looking toward the viewed item.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of facing up:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Above you is bright sky.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We also need to tell distant rooms how to describe themselves.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;look toward [any adjacent room]&quot; as looking toward.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Looking toward is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check looking toward a room which does not contain something mentionable:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if building description is false:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can't make out anything of interest that way.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out looking toward:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the chosen direction is the best route from the location to the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the second noun is the room the chosen direction from the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun contains something mentionable:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through mentionable things in the noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carry out the writing a distant paragraph about activity with the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun contains something mentionable:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increment the count of sentences;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose row count of sentences in the Table of Distance Sentences;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is an outdoors room and the second noun contains something mentionable, say &quot;[both entry] [run paragraph on]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;[here entry] [run paragraph on]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is an outdoors room and the second noun contains something mentionable:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increment the count of sentences;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose row count of sentences in the Table of Distance Sentences;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[there entry] [run paragraph on]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And again, some exception needs to be made for seeing what's in the dip in the ground:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of looking toward the Ha-ha:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the chosen direction is the best route from the location to the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the second noun is the room the chosen direction from the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is an outdoors room and the second noun contains something mentionable:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increment the count of sentences;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose row count of sentences in the Table of Distance Sentences;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[there entry] [run paragraph on]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The following is to account for cases where the player types &quot;look toward obelisk&quot; or similar, rather than looking toward a room:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;look toward [something]&quot; as examining.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The following is arguably an unnecessary refinement, but the listing of items in the distance gets a bit repetitive unless we vary the sentence structure.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Chosen direction is a direction that varies.

<p>
<p>Now, our ability to view things at a distance should be determined by the size of the things we're trying to see:

<p>We might also want to be able to override, manually, the way distant things are described.
