<p>&quot;Disenchantment Bay&quot; is a simple work of IF used as a running example in Chapter 3 of <i>Writing with Inform</i> - not so much a tutorial as a convenient hook on which to hang some demonstrations of the basics. Because the resulting examples only use basic features and in the most straightforward way, they make for uninteresting &quot;recipes&quot; - so they are not included in the <i>Recipe Book</i> proper. But some readers might like to have all twelve stages of the example gathered on a single page: this is that page.

<a name="e50"><a href=Rdoc3.html#e50 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 33: Disenchantment Bay 11</b></a><br>Disenchantment Bay: making a holdall of the backpack.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#ffffc0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>If we wanted, we could make the player's backpack infinitely capacious, so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The backpack is a player's holdall.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...And now whenever the player character is unable to hold everything, he will automatically stow some of his possessions therein.
<p>
<p>This is only useful if the player doesn't have infinite carrying capacity himself, so perhaps we also need
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The carrying capacity of the player is 3.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Perhaps mercifully, items which are worn are not counted against the player's carrying capacity. We might want to let him take advantage of that, too:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The backpack is wearable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This capacity system makes a compromise between the realistic and the absurd: on the one hand, it acknowledges that people can't carry an infinite number of items in their hands, while at the same time providing a sack that can.
<p>
<p>Many games will have no use for object-juggling of this kind at all; others will want to be much more rigorous about questions of capacity and volume. Fortunately, it is easy to leave the whole business out by assigning no carrying capacity to anything. The tools to implement a more sophisticated capacity system are provided in the chapter on Units.
