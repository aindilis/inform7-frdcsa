Phrases to decide other things</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>A condition is a yes/no decision, but we can also take decisions where the result is a value. Suppose we want to create a concept of the &quot;grand prize&quot;, which will have different values at different times in play. Each time the &quot;grand prize&quot; is referred to, Inform will have to decide what its value is, and the following tells Inform how to make that decision:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide which treasure is the grand prize:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the Dark Room has been visited, decide on the silver bars;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on the plover's egg.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that we have to say what kind the answer will be: here it's a kind of thing called &quot;treasure&quot; (which we're supposing has already been created), and as it turns out only two treasures are ever eligible anyway (we're also supposing that the plover's egg and the silver bars are treasures already created, of course). And note also that the phrase must in all cases end with a &quot;decide on ...&quot; to say what the answer is:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>decide on </b>(value)<b></b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_decideon -->

<p>This phrase can only be used in the body of a definition of a phrase to decide a value. It causes the calculation to end immediately, with the outcome being the given value, which must be of the kind expected. Example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide which number is double (N - a number):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let D be N times N;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on D.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>Now that we have &quot;grand prize&quot; created, we can use it just as we would use any other value, so for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if taking the grand prize, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As this is something of a dialect difference between English speakers, &quot;what&quot; and &quot;which&quot; are synonymous here, i.e., we could equally well write something like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is the target score: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(A phrase to decide if something-or-other is exactly the same thing as a phrase to decide a truth state, and indeed, if we want to then we can use &quot;decide on T&quot;, where T is a truth state, in its definition. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide if time is short:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the time of day is after 10 PM, decide on true;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on whether or not Jennifer is hurried.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Decide on true&quot; is exactly equivalent to the more normally used &quot;decide yes&quot;, and of course it is optional. The last line is more interesting since it effectively delegates the answer to another condition.)

<a name="e431"><a href=doc184.html#e431 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 180: Witnessed 2</b></a><br>A piece of ghost-hunting equipment that responds depending on whether or not the meter is on and a ghost is visible or touchable from the current location.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Witnessed&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a device called a Trifield Natural EMF Meter. The description of the Meter is &quot;This cost a pretty penny off the internet, but it's worth it: according to the website it has been programmed by PhD physicists to ignore manmade sources of fields and to respond only to paranormal EMF changes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">It also features an optional Tone Alarm, which can be turned on to indicate when readings spike. If the alarm is off, the meter just reads out the magnetic and electric field levels on a scale from 0-100 microteslas, or 0-1000 V/m.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Since both fields are important, you keep the meter set to SUM mode. The meter has its own optional backlighting, so that you can see the reading even if your flashlight is off. Currently it is reading at [meter setting].&quot; A Tone Alarm is part of the Meter. It is a device. The description of the Tone Alarm is &quot;The Tone Alarm will make a noise, if the EMF picks up a spike.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is meter setting:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the meter is switched off, decide on 0;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a ghost is touchable, decide on 35;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a ghost is visible, decide on 12;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on 0.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After switching on the meter:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You turn on the meter. The needle steadies at [meter setting].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn: if the meter setting is greater than 10 and the Tone Alarm is switched on, say &quot;[The Tone Alarm] shrieks.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Thirtieth Street Station is a room. &quot;A huge, high, rectangular room with coffered ceilings, which looks grand but mostly makes you feel lonely and small. There are long benches in rows down the middle of the room, and an information desk with the train times, and a series of ticket windows, none of which matters very much at the moment.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The benches are an enterable supporter. They are scenery in the Station. The information desk is scenery in the Station. Some ticket windows are scenery in the Station. Instead of examining scenery in the Station: say &quot;You're fairly sure that whatever is going on here has nothing to do with [the noun].&quot; Understand &quot;window&quot; as ticket windows.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The mural is fixed in place in Thirtieth Street. &quot;At the north side of the station is a particularly pointless and empty annex to the main room. It is dominated by a huge relief of sorts, and this is what you remember.&quot; Understand &quot;metal&quot; or &quot;relief&quot; or &quot;huge&quot; as the mural. The description of the mural is &quot;It is both stylized and confusing, but you think it might be supposed to represent the various tasks and occupations of Philadelphia's population. The portions closer to the ground look as though they have recently been subjected to a light dusting of talcum powder. No unusual prints are evident.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The wind chimes are fixed in place in Thirtieth Street. &quot;Carefully attached to the wall with a piece of duct tape and a hook is a light-weight set of wind chimes. Someone else has been here before you, it seems.&quot; The description is &quot;Several of your friends use wind chimes as a sort of ghost alarm, since ghosts sometimes cause very localized movements of air when there is no natural breeze.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A ghost is a kind of person. The pale figure is a ghost.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 9:03 AM: move the pale figure to the location; say &quot;You shiver with some sort of presence.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;turn on alarm / turn on meter / z / z / z / x figure&quot;.
