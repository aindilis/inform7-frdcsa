<p>When we write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is usually dark.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>we are saying that it will be dark rather than lighted unless we should specify otherwise. So it would be fine to add:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Tortuous Alcove is lighted.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because although dead ends are usually dark, this one is evidently an exception. On the other hand, if we had originally written
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is always dark.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then Inform would not have permitted any exception to be made, and would have reported a problem if we had tried to make the Tortuous Alcove lighted. Besides &quot;usually&quot; and &quot;always&quot;, we can also employ &quot;seldom&quot; and &quot;never&quot;, which are their negatives. Thus, &quot;never lighted&quot; means the same as &quot;always dark&quot;.

<a name="e270"><a href=doc57.html#e270 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 42:  Odin</b></a><br>Replacing "You see nothing special..." with a different default message for looking at something nondescript.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>In recent years there has been a strong trend towards providing unique descriptions for all implemented objects. Often this is a good idea, but there are also contexts in which we may want to discourage the player from looking too closely at some things and concentrate his attention on just a few interesting ones.
<p>
<p>The trick here is that leaving items completely undescribed leads to rather dull exchanges like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>x table
<br>You see nothing special about the table.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...which can leave the player with the impression that the author was simply too lazy to describe everything. So it can be a good idea to replace that default message with a different one more appropriate to the game. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Odin&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The House of a Mortal Farmer is a room. &quot;Having two separate rooms, this house testifies to considerable wealth and success at agriculture.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Bedroom is inside from the House.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A chair is a kind of supporter. A chair is always enterable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the House are a table, two chairs, a basket, and a hearth. On the table is a loaf of bread.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of a thing is usually &quot;You give [the noun] a glance, but it is plainly beneath your attention.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Because the description is attached to a whole kind (&quot;thing&quot;), it is really a blanket instruction about many objects at once. More specific instructions always override less specific ones, so we can easily make exceptions. For instance, the following will work correctly:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The infant is a man in the basket. The description of the infant is &quot;So strong and fat that you wonder whether one of your fellow gods is acquainted with the mistress of the house-- but it's no concern of yours, of course.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x table / x chair / x infant&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
