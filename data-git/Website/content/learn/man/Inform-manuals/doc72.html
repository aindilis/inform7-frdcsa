<p>
<p>In the previous chapter, we gave properties to certain kinds of things in order to change their appearance and behaviour, and saw brief glimpses of one of Inform's most useful devices: text substitution. The following gives a more complete example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;The Undertomb&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is a kind of room with printed name &quot;Dead End&quot; and description &quot;This is a dead end. You'll have to go back the way you came, consoled only by [river sound].&quot; A dead end is usually dark.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Undertomb is a dark room. East is a dead end. South is a dead end with printed name &quot;Collapsed Dead End&quot;. Northwest is a dead end called the Tortuous Alcove. In the Undertomb is the lantern. It is lit.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end has some text called river sound. The river sound of a dead end is usually &quot;a faint whispering of running water&quot;. The Tortuous Alcove has river sound &quot;a gurgle of running water&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The novelty here is the text in square brackets in the first paragraph. They imply more or less what they would when a journalist is quoting something in a newspaper article. The actual words &quot;river sound&quot; are not part of the text. Instead, when Inform prints up the description of a dead end, it will substitute the appropriate river sound in place of these words.
<p>
<p>Thus the description of the Collapsed Dead End is &quot;This is a dead end. You'll have to go back the way you came, consoled only by a faint whispering of running water.&quot;, whereas the description of the Tortuous Alcove is &quot;This is a dead end. You'll have to go back the way you came, consoled only by a gurgle of running water.&quot; As the player explores these dead ends, subtle differences will appear in their room descriptions.
