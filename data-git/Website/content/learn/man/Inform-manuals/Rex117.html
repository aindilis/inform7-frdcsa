<p>Calvin Coolidge once described windows as &quot;rectangles of glass.&quot; For us, they have two purposes: first, they offer a view of landscape beyond. In the simplest case the view is of an area which will not be interacted with in play, and therefore does not need to adapt to whatever may have changed there:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The window is scenery in the Turret. &quot;Through the window you see miles and miles of unbroken forest, turning from green to flame in the hard early autumn.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>More interesting is to adapt the view a little to provide a changing picture: a forest may not change much, but a street scene will. <b>Port Royal 4</b> allows us to glimpse random passers-by.
<p>
<p>The trickiest kind of window allows the player to see another room which can also be encountered in play, and to interact with what is there. <b>Dinner is Served</b> presents a shop window, allowing people to see inside from the street, and even to reach through.
<p>
<p><b>Vitrine</b> handles the complication of a window misting up to become opaque, and thus temporarily hiding its view.
<p>
<p>Second, windows provide openings in walls and can act as conduits. <b>Escape</b> shows how a &quot;door&quot; in the Inform sense can become a window. <b>A Haughty Spirit</b> provides a general kind of window for jumping down out of: ideal for escapers from Colditz-like castles.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The smart window is a device in Plaza View. It is fixed in place. &quot;A vast smart window [if transparent]overlooks the park[otherwise]has turned to a sheet of hazy blue[end if].&quot; The smart window can be transparent. The smart window is transparent. The description is &quot;An electrochromic device which changes shade and transparency in response to the application of current.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Curtains are so last year.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note the &quot;can be transparent&quot; line. Devices ordinarily are not allowed to have transparency or opaqueness, but we can make an exception in this case. Without that line, attempts to change the transparency of the window will fail.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out switching off the window: now the window is transparent.
