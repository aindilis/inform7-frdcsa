<p>Items are ordinarily understood only by their original given names. For instance, if we have:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Herb Garden is a china pot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then the player could refer to this as &quot;pot&quot;, &quot;china pot&quot; or &quot;china&quot;. We can embellish this by adding extra forms:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;chinese pot&quot; or &quot;chinese vase&quot; as the china pot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But suppose the pot changes its nature in the course of play? If we have:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The china pot can be unbroken or broken. The china pot is unbroken.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After dropping the china pot:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Crack!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the china pot is broken;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the printed name of the pot is &quot;broken pot&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So now the player would reasonably expect to call it &quot;broken pot&quot;, a wording which would have been rejected before. We can achieve this by writing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the unbroken property as describing the pot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which allows &quot;unbroken&quot; or &quot;broken&quot; to describe the pot, depending on its state. And, since the player might well use a different adjective but with the same idea in mind, we can even add:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;shattered&quot; or &quot;cracked&quot; or &quot;smashed&quot; as broken. Understand &quot;pristine&quot; as unbroken.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is something of a toy example, but the feature looks rather more useful when there are more pots than just one:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Terracotta&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A flowerpot is a kind of thing. A flowerpot can be unbroken or broken. Understand the broken property as describing a flowerpot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After dropping an unbroken flowerpot:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Crack!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun is broken;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the printed name of the noun is &quot;broken flowerpot&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the printed plural name of the noun is &quot;broken flowerpots&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Herb Garden is a room. In the Herb Garden are ten unbroken flowerpots.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We then have the dialogue:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Herb Garden
<br>You can see ten flowerpots here.
<br>>get two flowerpots
<br>flowerpot: Taken.
<br>flowerpot: Taken.
<br>>drop all
<br>flowerpot: Crack!
<br>flowerpot: Crack!
<br>>look
<br>Herb Garden
<br>You can see two broken flowerpots and eight flowerpots here.
<br>>get an unbroken flowerpot
<br>Taken.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and so on and so forth.
<p>
<p>There are in fact two slightly different forms of this kind of sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the broken property as describing a flowerpot.
<br>Understand the broken property as referring to a flowerpot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The only difference is that in the &quot;describing&quot; case, the property's name alone can mean the thing in question - so &quot;take unbroken&quot; will work; whereas, in the &quot;referring to&quot;, the property's name can only be used as an adjective preceding the name of thing itself - so &quot;take unbroken flowerpot&quot; will work but &quot;take unbroken&quot; will not.

<p>
<p>Named properties are not the only kind that Inform is able to understand referring to an object. We can also use unit and number properties to distinguish things from one another, as here, where televisions have aspect ratios:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Aspect&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An aspect ratio is a kind of value. 16:9 specifies an aspect ratio.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A television is a kind of device. A television has an aspect ratio. Understand the aspect ratio property as referring to a television. Understand &quot;European standard&quot; as 16:9.

<p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;examine european standard tv / x 16:9 tv / x 4:3 tv&quot;.
