<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> Whenever the name of a thing or room is printed.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> For items other than the current player, the &quot;printed name&quot; property is printed out; but for the current player, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;yourself&quot; is printed. (That doesn't necessarily mean that the &quot;printed name&quot; of the player is never used. Suppose there are two people, Alice and Bob, and the narrative switches between them: when Alice is the player, she appears as &quot;yourself&quot; but Bob is &quot;Bob&quot;; but when Bob is the player, he is &quot;yourself&quot; and Alice is &quot;Alice&quot;.)
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) A pen which is described differently in inventories:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of the pen while taking inventory: say &quot;useful pen&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Taking inventory&quot; is a condition which is true if that's the current action and not otherwise, so the effect is that the pen is called &quot;a useful pen&quot; only in inventory listings. &quot;While looking&quot; is a similarly useful one.
<p>
<p>(b) Italicising the names of novels:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A novel is a kind of thing. Dr Zhivago and Persuasion are novels. Before printing the name of a novel, say &quot;[italic type]&quot;. After printing the name of a novel, say &quot;[roman type]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(c) Telling the time:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the name of the wrist watch while taking inventory: say &quot; (time: [the time of day])&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(d) Merging containers with their contents:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of the bottle while not inserting or removing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the bottle contains sand, say &quot;bottle of sand&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;empty bottle&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;omit contents in listing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This example makes use of a special phrase:
<p>
<p><p style='padding: 0.75em; border: 1px dashed #2f6fab; color: black; background-color: #e9e9e9; line-height: 1.5em; '><b>omit contents in listing</b><table CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 width='100%'><tr><td halign='left' valign='center' CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><font>
<!-- definition of ph_omit -->

<p>This phrase changes the form of an inventory listing, room description, etc., so that it will simply list &quot;a bottle of sand&quot; or &quot;an empty bottle&quot;, rather than &quot;a bottle (in which is sand)&quot; or &quot;a bottle (which is empty)&quot;. It should be used only when the listing is imminent, and does not have permanent effect.
<p>
<!-- end definition -->
</table>
<p>
<p>The clause about not inserting or removing is to prevent messages like &quot;You put the sand in the bottle of sand.&quot;, where it's confusing to refer to the bottle as anything other than &quot;the bottle&quot;.

<!-- EXAMPLE START -->
<a name="e347"><a href=doc291.html#e347 STYLE="text-decoration: none">*<b><b>Example</b> 326:  Shipping Trunk</b></a><br>A box of baking soda whose name changes to "completely ineffective baking soda" when it is in a container with something that smells funny.<p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font>
<p>
<p>First to lay some groundwork:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Shipping Trunk&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A chest is a kind of container. A chest is always openable. A lid is a kind of supporter. A lid is part of every chest.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before opening a chest when something (called the obstruction)  is on the lid which is part of the noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Better remove [the obstruction].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be innocent or smelly.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Storage Unit is a room. The shipping trunk is a closed chest in the Storage Unit. The trunk contains some garlic, a loaf of moldy sourdough, a mildewy bathtowel, a pair of unwashed socks, two dead trout, and a box of baking powder. The garlic, trout, sourdough, bathtowel, and socks are smelly. The baking powder is innocent.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The shipping trunk's lid supports a small card. The description of the small card is &quot;'Please, please do not open this trunk.'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After opening the trunk:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the trunk had been open:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You steel yourself...&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;There roils up from inside an indescribable funk, which, when you can see straight, you have no trouble attributing to the presence of [a list of smelly things in the trunk]. You also note [a list of innocent things in the trunk] in the corner.&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now, with that preparation:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before printing the name of the baking powder when the powder is in a container which contains a smelly thing: say &quot;completely ineffective &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;open trunk / examine card / get card / open trunk / get powder / inventory&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
