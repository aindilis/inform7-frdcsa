<p>
<p>Sometimes we want Inform to apply a player's action to a different target than the one specified: for instance, directing all (or almost all) commands from the doorknob to the door of which it is a part. <b>Fine Laid</b> demonstrates how to do this. Along the same lines, <b>Lucy</b> shows how to direct a player's conversation action to apply to a new conversation topic.
<p>
<p>We can also record a series of actions performed by the player or by another character.
<p>
<p><b>Cactus Will Outlive Us All</b> demonstrates characters each of whom reacts to a very specific provocation; <b>I Didn't Come All The Way From Great Portland Street</b> implements a game show in which the player is not allowed ever to repeat an action he has already performed; and <b>Leopard-skin</b> implements a maze which the player can escape only by performing a specific sequence of actions.
<p>
<p><b>Anteaters</b> provides a peculiar gizmo that can remember actions performed in its presence and force the player to reiterate them.
